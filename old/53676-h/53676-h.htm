<h1 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">A DANGEROUS FLIRTATION;</h1>

<h4>OR</h4>

<h3>DID IDA MAY SIN?</h3>

<hr class="r5" />

<p class="ph2" style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></p>


<p>Three young girls, as fair as youth and beauty could
make them, stood with arms twined about one another
on the sands of Newport one hot August afternoon.</p>

<p>Neither of the trio could have been over seventeen.
All three were dressed in white, and looked as delightfully
cool, sweet and airy, with their floating white ribbons
and wind-blown curls, as summer maidens can
possibly look.</p>

<p>"If I were an artist, I would immortalize that glorious
scene," cried Lily Ryder, her blue eyes sparkling with
the fire of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"And if I were an artist, I would paint <i>you</i>," cried a
handsome, fair-haired young man <i>sotto voce</i>, who had
stopped short in his stroll along the sands with his
friend, to admire the three lovely young girls, feeling
sure that his keen scrutiny would not be observed, they
were gazing so intently out to sea.</p>

<p>"Who are they, Ravenswood?" he asked, eagerly,
turning to his companion. "You know everyone at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Newport worth knowing, of course&mdash;'a golden key
throws open all doors.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course," echoed Philip Ravenswood, with the
slow drawl habitual to him. "They are called at Newport
'The Three Graces.' The blonde fairy to the right
is Lily Ryder, an ex-governor's daughter. The bewitching
girl in the center of the group is Miss Hildegarde
Cramer, a banker's daughter; and, by the way, she's one
of the jolliest girls that ever dazzled a fellow's wits as
well as his eyes&mdash;looks more bewitching every time you
see her."</p>

<p>"But who is the other young girl?" interrupted his
companion, impatiently. "According to my ideas of
feminine loveliness, she's far the prettiest of the three."</p>

<p>"Hold on, my dear Royal Ainsley, lest you provoke
a duel here and now. Remember, that trio contains the
peerless Hildegarde," laughed Philip Ravenswood, relighting
a fresh Havana.</p>

<p>"All allowance made for difference of opinion," smiled
Ainsley; "but really, Phil, who is the dark-eyed beauty
this way?"</p>

<p>Little dreaming of what would come of those few idly
spoken words, Philip Ravenswood answered, carelessly:</p>

<p>"Her name is Ida May. She's the only living relative
of the Mays of Boston, I understand. I do not know the
Mays personally, but know them well by reputation.
They are fabulously rich, it is generally believed."</p>

<p>"Suppose you introduce me to the Three Graces," said
Royal Ainsley, banteringly.</p>

<p>His companion flushed, and looked a trifle uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"At another time, my dear fellow," he said, answering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Ainsley's question after a moment's pause. "Let
the girls enjoy their rhapsodies over the sunset in peace
this time. We really haven't time just now. The fellows
are waiting for us at the club, you know."</p>

<p>But Ainsley refused to go on; yet he did it in such a
gay, off-hand, rollicking, fun-loving fashion, his friend
did not see the fixed purpose in his action.</p>

<p>He was quite sure that if they stood there long enough
they could not help attracting the attention of the pretty
maidens, and there was no time like the present to meet
them. In this surmise, he was quite correct. Attracted
by the sound of voices almost behind them, Miss Ryder
glanced around.</p>

<p>"Hildegarde&mdash;Ida!" she exclaimed, in a flutter of delighted
surprise, "why, here is Mr. Ravenswood!"</p>

<p>She stopped short, for just then she observed that the
handsome young gentleman in the white linen suit,
standing a little apart from Mr. Ravenswood, was with
him.</p>

<p>It was too late to beat a retreat then, for he had been
discovered. He was certainly in for it, and there was
no help for it but to bring his companion forward with
the best possible grace and present him to the young
ladies.</p>

<p>Ainsley bowed low in his most charming manner, raising,
with a smile, his white straw hat from his fair, clustering
hair, and Philip Ravenswood could see, with consternation,
the apparent admiration for his friend on all
three girlish faces, including Hildegarde, whom he had
believed to be quite smitten with himself.</p>

<p>Royal Ainsley made the most of that next half hour
on the sands. He was so brilliant, so witty, so clever, he
fairly astonished his friend, used as he was to his gay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
<i>bon-mots</i> and to see him the life of all the affairs at the
club.</p>

<p>They chatted brightly enough, until Hildegarde exclaimed,
with a little cry:</p>

<p>"Why, there is some bell striking seven! We have
been here over an hour. We must get back to the hotel,
girls, or we will never be dressed for dinner. Won't
you stroll back that way with us?" she added, with a
dazzling smile to both of the young gentlemen.</p>

<p>"I think not," replied Ainsley, quickly, taking it upon
himself to answer for his friend. "We have an engagement,
and have barely time to save ourselves from
being the annoying cause of giving our friends a cold
dinner."</p>

<p>"We hope to see you both soon again," said Lily,
with another blush.</p>

<p>"We do, indeed!" echoed Hildegarde, archly. But
the girl with the velvet pansy eyes made no audible remark,
though her crimson lips parted, then shut quickly
again.</p>

<p>The next moment the two gentlemen were gone, and
the three young girls retraced their steps slowly hotelward
along the beach. They had a much pleasanter subject
to discuss now than the sunset.</p>

<p>"Isn't the new-comer handsome?" remarked Lily.</p>

<p>"Splendid! but not quite as Phil, though."</p>

<p>Again they both asked together:</p>

<p>"What say <i>you</i>, Ida?"</p>

<p>The girl with cheeks like a damask rose and velvety
pansy eyes blushed to the roots of her jetty curls.</p>

<p>"He is like the hero of a novel. I have never seen
any one so handsome before&mdash;so fair, so smiling&mdash;so&mdash;so&mdash;delightful,"
she answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ida May's heart has been hit by the first shot of
those arrows of blue eyes," laughed Lily, mockingly. "I
knew when she declared that, come what would, she
would not fall in love with any young man she met at
Newport, she was more than likely to meet her fate."</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>


<p>For some moments the two young men walked on in
silence, which was at last broken by Ainsley.</p>

<p>"I say, Phil," he began, eagerly, laying his hand on
his friend's shoulder, "do you think any one of those
three beauties would accept an invitation to go down and
see the yacht-race with me to-morrow afternoon?"</p>

<p>Ravenswood looked shocked.</p>

<p>"You are surely jesting to ask my opinion as to
whether any one of those young girls would accompany
<i>a stranger</i> to a place of amusement. You certainly know,
as well as I do, that they wouldn't entertain such a
thought for an instant. And even suppose they did?
Their parents would soon let you know what <i>they</i> thought
on the subject. Like all sweet rosebuds, they are guarded
by thorns. A very stern <i>duenna</i> usually accompanies
them on their afternoon rambles, and woe to anything
masculine who attempts to hold a few moments' conversation
with any one of them. I confess I was surprised
to find them alone to-day&mdash;very much surprised, I must
say."</p>

<p>"Fate interposed in my behalf," laughed Ainsley, nonchalantly;
adding: "I tell you, Phil, I am a strong believer
in fate, no matter what any one says to the contrary,
believing with the poet&mdash;everything is preordained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
planned out ahead for us, and we can not escape it. We
are to meet certain people. One girl makes no impression
upon us whatever, no matter how pretty she may be;
we meet another, and lo! with the first glance from her
eyes, the mischief's done&mdash;<i>we</i> are done for. Now, am I
not correct?"</p>

<p>"I hope you have not made such a fool of yourself
as to fall in love at first sight with any one of those young
ladies to whom I was mad enough to introduce you,
Ainsley!" cried Ravenswood, very much nettled.</p>

<p>"And why not, pray?" returned Royal Ainsley, coolly.
"You should blame fate if I have done so, not me, my
dear fellow."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for you, Ainsley, if such is indeed a fact,"
declared Philip Ravenswood, gravely, "for I do not
think you could win the girl. Plainly speaking, you are
no match for either of them. You know that. But
which one of them is it?"</p>

<p>"The one with the pansy velvet dark eyes&mdash;with the
face of a damask rose&mdash;Ida May, I believe you called
her."</p>

<p>Ravenswood looked wonderfully relieved. As long as
it was not Hildegarde, he would not trouble himself.</p>

<p>"By George!" exclaimed Ainsley, stopping short, "I
believe those three young girls ride the bicycle. Now
that I think of it, I'm sure I saw them whirl past the
club yesterday morning. They wore natty navy blue
suits and blue veils. I couldn't see what their faces
were like. Two elderly gentlemen accompanied them."</p>

<p>"Yes, they ride the wheel," assented Ravenswood, reluctantly.
"The two gentlemen were Mr. Ryder and Mr.
Cramer, who are very enthusiastic over the sport.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
There's a millionaire's club of wheelmen here at Newport."</p>

<p>"I presume they will be at the fancy masquerade
cycle tournament next week, then?" said Ainsley, carelessly,
though he listened anxiously for the reply.</p>

<p>"No doubt," returned Ravenswood. "They were all
at the last one. By the way, it's a very select affair.
One has to be a member of the club, or have considerable
outside influence, to secure tickets."</p>

<p>"Are you a member?" asked Ainsley, quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes," returned Ravenswood. "It was Hildegarde's
father who proposed my name. I did not get even one
black ball, and was consequently voted a member."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose, if you had been a poor devil of a
clerk, instead of a millionaire's son, you would have been
voted in?" asked Ainsley, a trifle bitterly, a hard light
flashing into his eyes.</p>

<p>"Possibly not," replied Ravenswood, with a good-humored
laugh.</p>

<p>"I should have thought you would have improved the
opportunity of seeing considerable of the Three Graces
awheel," said Ainsley, after a few moments' pause.</p>

<p>"Their fathers discourage anything of that kind,"
laughed Philip; "as more than one young man has
found out."</p>

<p>"But Miss May's relatives&mdash;do none of them ride?"</p>

<p>"They are too old for that sort of thing," laughed
Ravenswood. "The old gentleman is as deaf as a post,
and is relegated to the hotel piazza because of the gout.
His wife is equally as deaf, and is too unwieldly to venture
far from her corner of the piazza. It is laughable to
hear them shout at each other through their ear-trumpets.
I have often thought what a lonely life of it that beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
young girl must have with those two old people. It
would be unendurable, I fancy, if it were not for her
two young friends."</p>

<p>"Probably they make up for not being companionable
by not being so strict with their pretty prospective little
heiress?" suggested Ainsley, again listening eagerly for
his friend's reply.</p>

<p>"They certainly allow their granddaughter, or niece,
whichever she is, more liberty than Hildegarde's or Lily
Ryder's parents do. Still, I suppose they are confident
that she can come to no harm, surrounded by such careful
friends and companions."</p>

<p>"Did you say, Philip, you were going to the fancy-dress
masquerade tournament?" asked Royal Ainsley,
slowly.</p>

<p>"I do not propose to miss it," responded Ravenswood.</p>

<p>"Do you think you can secure me a ticket, Phil?"
asked Ainsley, point-blank. "Grant me that favor if
you can. Remember, I ask it <i>as a great favor</i>. Surely
you can manage it somehow for me."</p>

<p>"I'll try," replied Ravenswood. "If it's possible, you
shall attend."</p>

<p>During the next few days that followed, handsome
Royal Ainsley saw as much of the Three Graces as was
possible. One day he was content with a bow or a smile&mdash;on
the next, a few words in passing; but he was wise
enough to keep out of the way whenever their relatives
were about.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>


<p>The fancy-dress masquerade cycle carnival had been
the talk of fashionable circles in Newport for the last
fortnight, and now, as the auspicious evening drew near,
excitement was almost at fever heat.</p>

<p>The tickets of admission had been closely guarded;
gold could not buy them. The tickets, which were
strictly <i>not transferable</i>, had been duly delivered by messengers
to the different members whose names they bore,
and the promoters of the affair felt duly satisfied that no
one outside the charmed circle of Newport's fashionable
Four Hundred could by any possibility invade the sacred
precincts.</p>

<p>A whole army of officers were to guard against intruders.
There was to be a banquet in the supper-room
at midnight, after the masks of the merry cyclers had
been removed, that would be so startling in its sumptuousness
that the whole country would be talking about it,
and those who had been fortunate enough to attend
would never forget it in their after lives.</p>

<p>Philip Ravenswood had indeed done his utmost to secure
the admittance of his friend; but even he had
failed signally. The officers were inexorable in their
polite but firm refusal to his request.</p>

<p>Two hours later the grand masquerade cycle carnival
was at its height. The marble walls of the millionaire
club never held a more brilliant gathering of ladies fair,
with eyes behind silken masks brighter than the diamonds
they wore, and men braver than the famous knights of
old in their powdered wigs, satin knee-breeches and
spangled waistcoats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>One wheelman, in the costume of handsome Romeo,
sprung from his wheel near one of the fountains, and
watched with keen eyes through his mask the cyclers as
they passed him one after another.</p>

<p>"Aha! I have them at last," he muttered, as he noted
three wood-nymphs hovering close together. "Well, I
declare, I thought I should have little difficulty in distinguishing
one from the other," he muttered; "but to
save my life, I can not tell them apart. I shall trust
to fate to choose for me, hoping it will be the beauteous
Hildegarde."</p>

<p>Suddenly two plumed cavaliers sprung from their
wheels before the two foremost wood-nymphs, and asked
permission in silent pantomime to ride as their escorts
around the rink, which request was graciously acceded
to, but with the dignity of young princesses.</p>

<p>"This is my opportunity," thought Romeo. "I must
claim the remaining wood-nymph before some other fellow
has the chance to capture her."</p>

<p>The next instant he was bowing low before her.</p>

<p>"May I have the great honor of riding as your escort
around the rink, fair wood-nymph?" he whispered in
a low, melodious voice. "Ah, pardon my speaking; it
was purely a slip of the tongue. I should have made
known my request in pantomime. But pray forgive, and
do not betray me, fairest of all maidens, to the floor manager,
pray, or I shall be ordered from the floor in deep
disgrace."</p>

<p>"If she answers, I shall know by her voice which one
of the three heiresses she is," he thought.</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall not betray you, Mr. Ainsley," replied the
girl, with a jolly little laugh, showing the whitest of
pearly teeth, "and I accept your escort to ride with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
me. I&mdash;I am so afraid of tumbling off my wheel, this
gay throng and the flashing lights bewilder me so. I&mdash;I
was just wondering if you would be here to-night."</p>

<p>"Fair maid, you know me?" he whispered, in apparent
amazement. "I am astounded, yet flattered. Pray
be kind enough to exchange confidences. I have been
hoping against hope that <i>you</i> are the one whom I longed
to see here. Surely the throbbings of my heart tell me
who you are, fair nymph. Shall I breathe to you the
name of her whom I ardently wish it to be?" he asked,
softly.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, eagerly; and there was no mistaking
the characteristic catching of the breath, and the
intense, eager gaze in the velvety eyes behind the silken
mask.</p>

<p>He crushed the furtive hope that had stirred his heart
for an instant that it might be Hildegarde, and answered,
boldly:</p>

<p>"I prayed the fates to lead me to the feet of beauteous
Ida May! Oh, tell me&mdash;am I right? Do be kind, and
tell me."</p>

<p>"Then the fates have answered your prayer," she replied.
"I suppose I ought <i>not</i> to tell you until unmasking
time, but really I can not help it. I <i>am</i> Ida May."</p>

<p>"Thanks, ten thousand thanks for ending my suspense,
dear girl," he murmured, as only Royal Ainsley could
utter the words. A few sweeps around the rink, where
handsome Romeo, with his superb fancy riding, was the
cynosure of all eager feminine eyes, midst murmurs of
admiration, then he whispered to his companion: "Come
into the conservatory; the air is too close here. You
are riding as though you were dizzy. Are you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered. "I <i>must</i> have air. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>The wheel suddenly wobbled recklessly from side to
side, as though its rider had lost control of it entirely.</p>

<p>Royal Ainsley sprung from his wheel just in time to
prevent her from falling, and in that instant he crushed
her closely to his heart, then as quickly released her.</p>

<p>The excitement was so great, no one noticed this little
by-play, or saw Romeo lead the fair wood-nymph from
amid the glittering lights to the shadowy depths of the
cool conservatory. Standing their wheels against a marble
Flora, he found a rustic bench on which he placed
her, taking a seat beside her, dangerously near, his hand
closing over the fluttering little white one, his handsome
head, with its fair, clustering hair, bent near her own.
A half hour they spent amid the dim, cool shadows, the
perfume of the roses enfolding them, the soft, low, bewildering
echo of the delicious music floating out to
them.</p>

<p>Remember, the young girl was only seventeen, dear
reader, otherwise the place, and the scene, and the fair,
handsome lover by her side could not have infatuated her
so quickly or so deeply.</p>

<p>"This is heaven!" he whispered. "How I wish we
could linger here forever, Ida&mdash;I your devoted knight,
and you my queen, the world forgetting, by the world
forgot! Do <i>you</i> wish it could be so?"</p>

<p>The low cadence of his voice; the thrilling touch of
that strong, white hand that was stealing around the supple
waist, drawing her toward him; the panting of his
breath, which she could feel on her flushed cheek; the
mesmeric, steady gaze of those bright blue, shining eyes,
bewildered her&mdash;made her heart flutter as it had never
fluttered before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you wish we could be always together, Ida?" he
persisted.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the girl, with a half sob of affright,
trembling under the strange spell that had slowly but
surely been cast over her.</p>

<p>"Then marry me, Ida!" he cried, "this very night&mdash;within
the hour, and no one can ever part us after that!
Oh, Ida, do not refuse me!" he urged. "I love you so
that I would die for you. Fate surely intended us for
each other, or we would never have met and loved as we
do. Oh, my darling, you can not deny it! You do love
me, Ida May?"</p>

<p>She strove with all her might to deny it; but, in spite
of herself, he wrung the truth from her lips&mdash;that she
<i>did</i> love him. A sudden light that she could not quite
understand leaped up into his eyes for a moment, and a
triumphant smile curved his lips.</p>

<p>"We shall be married to-night, Ida!" he cried. "I
will arrange it somehow;" and as he uttered the words,
he told himself that the great heiress was as good as
won.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>


<p>The crash of the music, the hum of voices, and the
song of the rippling fountains seemed to dazzle Ida May's
senses.</p>

<p>"Promise me that you will marry me, my darling!"
cried the impetuous lover. "Would it be so very difficult,
Ida?" he whispered.</p>

<p>She clung to him, the terror deepening in her eyes.</p>

<p>"This is a little romance all our own," he added,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
clasping her closely. "Ida, let me kiss you!" He
clasped his arms around her and drew her to his breast.
"You are mine in life, mine in death, and mine through
all eternity!"</p>

<p>He kissed the sweet lips over and over again.</p>

<p>She was so young that she believed him.</p>

<p>"Let us be married first, then we can talk over all
these things after!" he exclaimed, impetuously.</p>

<p>She was dazed by his passionate words.</p>

<p>He felt quite sure that this sweet, beautiful, dainty
young girl could not hold out against him if he only persisted.</p>

<p>One more bold stroke, and the heiress would be his.</p>

<p>There would be a scene, he well knew, when he brought
the young girl back to the old folks. But it would surely
end by their forgiving her. They could not hold out
against her very long.</p>

<p>"You are&mdash;sure&mdash;it&mdash;it&mdash;would be right, Mr. Ainsley?"
she faltered.</p>

<p>"You must not call me 'mister' sweet one," he cried.
"To you I shall be 'Royal' from now on to eternity.
Let me manage this affair, my darling," he added.</p>

<p>All power of resistance seemed swallowed up by his
indomitable will.</p>

<p>"Go to the cloak-room, my love," he whispered, "and
change your attire as quickly as you can. I will meet
you at the fountain nearest the entrance. Not one word
to either of your friends, Ida," he said, warningly.
"Promise me that!"</p>

<p>There was no crossing him. Indeed, the very power
to even think for herself seemed to have left her.</p>

<p>Like one in a dream, Ida May donned her street
clothes, the thought filling her mind of what Hildegarde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and Lily would say when it was unmasking time and
they came to look for her. How startled they would
be!</p>

<p>Outside all was confusion. There was a great crush
of carriages, the babble of coachmen and footmen, the
crunching of wheels, and the calling of numbers. To
the girl whom Royal Ainsley led on to so strange a fate
it seemed like a dream. Some one followed with their
wheels. Royal Ainsley took them from the man, and she
saw him toss him several pieces of silver.</p>

<p>He did not tell her that he had written a note to an
old minister, living two miles out of the village, asking
him to remain at home to marry them. No name had
been signed to the note; but he had argued to himself
that the minister, who probably was sadly in need of
making an extra dollar, would stay at home to perform
the ceremony. If his plans matured well, all well and
good; if they miscarried, well, no one would be the wiser
as to who sent the letter.</p>

<p>He assisted her to mount her wheel, and, as if in a
dream, they went speeding down the boulevard.</p>

<p>"We must make quicker time, my darling," he said.</p>

<p>Was it a sob he heard coming from the girl's lips?
Ida May seemed to have suddenly awakened to a sense
of what she had done. A brief half hour since she had
been in the midst of a brilliant party, and now, scarcely
knowing how it had come about, she found herself flying
with the handsome lover, whom she had known but a
few short weeks, going she knew not whither.</p>

<p>The awakening came to her like a terrible shock.</p>

<p>"Royal!" she cried, "oh, Royal, what have we done?
Where are we going? I did not mean to run away. I
must have been mad. Let us go back again!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>As she spoke, the great clock from some adjoining
tower struck the hour of twelve.</p>

<p>"We are too late," he said. "We have burned our
bridges behind us. They are unmasking now, and they
have missed you. They will soon institute a search."</p>

<p>She clasped his arm.</p>

<p>"Oh, Royal! I must tell you all!"</p>

<p>The hot, trembling hand clung to him, the lovely young
face was full of awful grief.</p>

<p>"My own darling!" he cried, leaning over and rapturously
embracing her, though in doing so he nearly
caused her to fall from her wheel.</p>

<p>Suddenly the heavens overhead seemed to darken, the
wind to freshen, and the booming of the waves, as they
dashed heavily against the shore, sounded dismally in the
distance.</p>

<p>"We must make haste," said Royal Ainsley; "there is
a storm coming up. I think we could save nearly half
a mile by cutting across this field."</p>

<p>He swung open a gate opening out into a broad patch
of land, and Ida rode in.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>


<p>"I see a light glimmering in a window a short distance
away. I will take you there, and walk back to the village
to get some kind of a conveyance."</p>

<p>In a few moments they found themselves knocking for
admission at the little cottage from whence they had
observed the light.</p>

<p>His impatient knock brought a white, terrified face to
a window which was opened above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you want?" asked a voice in unmistakable
tones of fear.</p>

<p>"I must have shelter for this young lady for a little
while," exclaimed Ainsley, impatiently; adding: "I will
pay you handsomely if you will allow her to remain here
an hour or two, until I can go for a carriage for her."</p>

<p>The window was closed quickly down again, and Royal
heard some one say quite distinctly:</p>

<p>"I tell you it is only a <i>ruse</i>. It is an officer of the
law."</p>

<p>Again Royal knocked impatiently.</p>

<p>"It is commencing to rain," he called. "For Heaven's
sake, open the door quickly!"</p>

<p>Despite the sobs and protestations of the voice inside,
a man opened the door and stepped out, confronting them.
One hand held a lighted lamp and the other rested upon
his hip pocket.</p>

<p>To Royal Ainsley's intense astonishment, he found
that he was at the summer cottage of Newport's haughty
mayor.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," stammered the man, in dire
confusion.</p>

<p>"It is rather late to awaken any one; but you have
heard the words, 'any port in a storm'? The truth is,
I want to find shelter for this young lady until I can go
for a conveyance to take her to a minister who is awaiting
us to perform the marriage ceremony."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is it!" exclaimed the mayor, with a look of
relief coming over his face. "An elopement, eh?"</p>

<p>"All is fair in love, you know," laughed the young
man, leading Ida into the parlor, his host preceding them.</p>

<p>"Who are you, and who is the young lady?" inquired
the man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Royal's turn to hesitate now. If he found out
that the young girl clinging to his arm was the heiress
of the Mays, would he not refuse to perform the ceremony
until they could be communicated with?</p>

<p>"I am Royal Ainsley," answered the young man, affecting
not to hear the last part of the question; and Ida,
thinking she was called upon to speak, responded,
promptly:</p>

<p>"And I am Ida May, sir."</p>

<p>The mayor wheeled about quickly.</p>

<p>"What! Did I hear you say the name May? Are
you the young girl stopping at the Ocean House whom
they call the niece of the Mays?"</p>

<p>The girl was trembling so she could not answer.</p>

<p>"We might as well put a bold front on the matter,"
whispered Royal, clasping quickly the ice-cold hands.</p>

<p>"She is, sir," he answered, with an air of assurance
which he was far from feeling.</p>

<p>The effect of his words upon his host was wonderful.
An expression that was almost diabolical flashed over his
face.</p>

<p>"Hold!" he cried. "You need look no further for a
minister; I will perform the ceremony. It is a pity for
the young lady to have to go out in the storm to have
a little service like that rendered. Old May's niece!"
he muttered under his breath. "Ah, what a glorious revenge
it is for me to give her to this profligate! Of
course, old May don't know anything about the escapade
of this girl!"</p>

<p>He clinched his hands tightly together as he looked at
her. There was no feature of old John May perceptible
in this slender little creature; but for all that, he hated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
her&mdash;ay, he hated her with a deadly hatred. <i>He knew
why.</i></p>

<p>"I will help you in this affair," he said, with a peculiar
laugh that might mean much or might mean little.</p>

<p>The ceremony was not a long one, and almost before
Ida could realize what was taking place, Royal Ainsley
was bending over her, and calling her his dear little wife.
But there was something about the kiss that he laid on
her lips that made a strange shiver creep over her.</p>

<p>Royal Ainsley could hardly conceal his triumph. No
matter if the Mays did find her now, they could not
undo what had been done. He had wedded her and her
millions!</p>

<p>"Is there a train that leaves for New York?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; one passes here in about twenty minutes from
now. By cutting across over to that side road you could
easily catch it."</p>

<p>Half an hour later, they were steaming toward the city
as fast as steam could carry them. The dark curly head
nestled against his shoulder, while Royal looked out of
the window, out into the blackness of the night, little
dreaming that he was on the eve of a terrible tragedy.</p>

<p>He had been lucky enough to secure the little compartment
at the rear of the drawing-room car, which those
who have money enough to pay for can secure exclusively
for themselves.</p>

<p>"I ought to tell you something that is weighing very
heavily upon my mind, Royal," she said, nestling closer
to her fair, handsome, boyish husband.</p>

<p>"Not until to-morrow, love," he declared, drawing her
toward him, and kissing her fondly.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>


<p>It was early the next morning when the Newport express
steamed into the Grand Central Depot.</p>

<p>Royal Ainsley cast a furtive glance around him as he
stepped upon the platform. He had quite expected a
dozen or more detectives to spring forward, for, of
course, the telegraph wires had been busy during the
night.</p>

<p>They would no doubt be waiting to arrest him for abducting
the heiress. But when he had blandly informed
them that lovely Ida May was his wife, what could they
do but fall back abashed and disconcerted.</p>

<p>To his great surprise, he seemed to create no sensation
whatever. No one even noticed him as he joined the
throng, with Ida May clinging tightly to his arm.</p>

<p>"I will give them some little trouble to find us," he
thought to himself.</p>

<p>He knew of a quiet, aristocratic family hotel facing the
park, and placing Ida in a carriage, he took a seat beside
her, and directed the driver to proceed as quickly as
possible to the place indicated.</p>

<p>Whirling through the streets of gay New York was
quite a sensation to Ida, who had never been outside of
her own country village, save for that fateful trip to
Newport.</p>

<p>With Royal clasping her two little fluttering hands
in one of his strong white ones, his left arm holding her
close as the cab rattled up Broadway, her fear of the
noise, the great rush of people hurrying hither and
thither, and the great crush of vehicles that threatened
to demolish them every moment, gradually subsided as
they rode along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>They reached their destination, and a moment more
were ushered into the little white-and-gold parlor.</p>

<p>"We will have the best breakfast that they can prepare,"
said Royal, "and then I shall take you to see the
sights of the city."</p>

<p>He was obliged to take the hotel clerk into his confidence.</p>

<p>"It's an elopement," he whispered in the clerk's ear.
"My bride is the heiress of the wealthy Mays, of Boston.
There may be a deuce of a row when they trace us to
this place, but it will end all right by the fatted calf
being killed for us. But as for the breakfast, how long
will it take to prepare it?"</p>

<p>"Not more than fifteen minutes," returned the clerk,
with an obsequious bow. "We will send up to the parlor,
and let you know when it is ready," he added.</p>

<p>He turned away with a royal air. Already he felt as
if the May millions were in his pocket, that he was a
man to be envied, that he was of great importance.</p>

<p>Royal Ainsley immediately joined Ida in the parlor.
He found her ensconced in one of the large velvet easy-chairs,
looking out of the window, with something very
like fright in her great dark eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, Royal, are you sure it is quite right?" she sobbed.
"Did you want me to marry you so very much?"</p>

<p>"What a silly little girl you are!" he cried, impetuously.
"Of course, I want you. I could not live without
you. I know you must be very hungry, as well as
tired from loss of sleep. Come over to this sofa and sit
down, and we will talk over our plans."</p>

<p>"Royal," she whispered, clasping his hands closer,
"you would not listen to me when I tried to tell you
something in the conservatory; but you must listen to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
me now. I can not be quite happy, dear, until you know
all. I&mdash;I have a confession to make."</p>

<p>He looked at her blankly.</p>

<p>"What odd words you use, my darling Ida!" he said.
"A confession! I do not like to hear you use such an
expression. I hope that there is no other lover in the
background?"</p>

<p>"It is not a lover!" she cried, clinging to him. "I
have never loved any one else but you!"</p>

<p>"Then it is all right, my angel!" he cried, brightly,
gathering her closely to him, despite the fact that people
were passing in the corridor outside, and had a full view
of all that was taking place within the room. She struggled
out of his arms, blushing like a peony, even though
she was his bride.</p>

<p>"Sit opposite me, where I can see you, and it will not
be so hard to tell you <i>all</i>," sobbed Ida, faintly.</p>

<p>He complied with her wishes.</p>

<p>"Cut the story as short as possible, dear," he said, "or
you will be obliged to have it continued in our next, as
breakfast will soon be ready."</p>

<p>"Oh, how shall I tell you the truth, Royal!" she said,
distressedly. "Perhaps you won't smile so when you
know all, and&mdash;and&mdash;you might even hate me."</p>

<p>"No matter what the little story is that you have to
tell me, my darling, I will love you better than ever."</p>

<p>"Oh, Royal, are you sure of it?" she cried, with that
frightened look which puzzled him so.</p>

<p>"Yes; I give you my word beforehand, that, no matter
what you have to tell me, I will love you all the
more!"</p>

<p>"I will tell you all, then, and throw myself on your
mercy to forgive me for the past," she sobbed. "Hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
my hands, Royal, closely in your own, while I tell you all
of the pitiful past, from beginning to end; and then,
Royal, you shall kiss my tears away, even&mdash;oh, Heaven,
pity me!&mdash;though I have sinned beyond pardon!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>


<p>Little dreaming of the purport of the story Ida had
to tell, Royal Ainsley drew near. For a moment, Ida
May's great somber eyes looked into his as though she
would read his very soul.</p>

<p>"Tell me over again that you will forgive me, no matter
what it is that I have to tell you."</p>

<p>"I have already given you that promise over and over
again," he declared. "Surely you don't want me to take
an oath to that effect?"</p>

<p>"Not if your solemn promise is strong enough to
bind you."</p>

<p>"You forget that you are wasting time, Ida?" he said,
good-humoredly.</p>

<p>"It will not take me long to tell my sad little story,"
she answered, with a half sob; "and oh, what a world
of comfort it will be for me to know that you will care
for me, no matter what the world may think. When you
hear my story you will understand the great temptation,
and will not judge me too cruelly.</p>

<p>"To begin with, my mother and I lived with a very
wealthy family in Dorchester. My mother was housekeeper,
and I&mdash;well, I had no regular position there, until,
owing to the meager salary they paid my mother, I
was compelled to learn telegraphy, and found a position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
at the station. To gain my mother's consent to do this
was extremely hard.</p>

<p>"'They will not be pleased, Ida,' she said, piteously.</p>

<p>"'What do the Deerings care for you or me?' I answered,
bitterly. 'Only to make you toil year in and year
out for a pittance so meager that it scarcely keeps body
and soul together!'</p>

<p>"'But they allow me to keep you with me, my dear
child. That is everything to a mother who is poor,' she
sighed.</p>

<p>"'I am not a child any longer,' I cried. 'I am quite
sixteen. I must be making money now, if ever, to help
you!'</p>

<p>"'But what can you do?' she asked.</p>

<p>"When I told her my plans, she looked at me dubiously.</p>

<p>"'Surely Mrs. Deering would not object,' I declared.</p>

<p>"But she did object. To my surprise she flew into a
terrible rage when I summoned courage enough to go to
the morning-room the next day and asked to speak to her.</p>

<p>"I unfolded to the cold, proud woman my plans to
make a living. She did not wait to hear me through, but
flew into such a passion of rage that I drew back in
terror.</p>

<p>"'I have different plans for you entirely, Ida May,'
she said. 'Go to your mother. I told her my plans
scarcely half an hour ago. She will unfold them to you.
Mind, they must be carried out by you, or your mother
and you will suffer. Your father owed us a sum of
money before he died, and during the past years your
mother has worked to pay us off. Over one-half yet
remains to be paid. Your mother's name is signed to
your father's notes of indebtedness, and she is responsible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
for them. If I pressed for payment and she could not
pay, she could be thrown into a debtor's prison.'</p>

<p>"I sobbed aloud in my terror: 'Oh, Mrs. Deering, if
this indeed be true, there is more need than ever for me
to earn money to pay off my mother's debts.'</p>

<p>"'There is another way in which you can pay them
off,' she answered.</p>

<p>"'Oh, how?' I cried, falling on my knees and clasping
my hands.</p>

<p>"The answer came like a crash of thunder from a clear
sky.</p>

<p>"'By marrying my nephew,' she said, harshly.</p>

<p>"I sprung to my feet in terror. Marry any one! I,
who was only a child!</p>

<p>"'My mother would not consent to anything like that,
even&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'She will be forced to consent!' was the harsh reply.
'My nephew will be here in a week.'</p>

<p>"I found my mother walking her room, wringing her
hands and tearing her hair. Her excitement was so
great that for a moment I was terrified.</p>

<p>"'Has she told you all, Ida?' she asked, in terror.</p>

<p>"'Yes, mother,' I answered.</p>

<p>"'And did she tell you what this nephew of hers was
like?'</p>

<p>"'No,' I replied, greatly puzzled by her manner.</p>

<p>"She shuddered as with a terrible chill.</p>

<p>"'Listen, Ida,' she said, in a strained, awful voice:
'Her nephew is such a horrid creature, that to be hated
he needs but to be seen. He is a hunchback&mdash;and&mdash;an
idiot&mdash;has a touch of insanity about him. Except the first
few years of his life, he has been confined in an asylum.
This nephew has a bachelor uncle, who has declared his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
intention to make the young man his heir if he marries
when he is twenty-one. Otherwise the great fortune
goes to another branch of the family. They would
make a victim of you, wreck your beautiful young life
for their own ambitious aims. It will be six months before
he is of age. But the marriage shall never be,
my darling. Your young life shall never be sacrificed
by these inhuman Shylocks. When the hour comes, we
will die together.'</p>

<p>"One day my mother met me with a white, awful face.</p>

<p>"'Mrs. Deering's nephew has arrived with a valet!'
she cried, under her breath.</p>

<p>"'But the six months are not up, mother," I cried. 'It
wants a fortnight to that time.'</p>

<p>"'He has come to stay until you make your decision.'</p>

<p>"Oh, God! the horror of it! Death a thousand times
over would have been preferable to that.</p>

<p>"How could I stand at the altar and promise to obey
a creature the very sight of whom filled me with disgust
and terror?</p>

<p>"I fled through the village, not daring to look behind
me, and never stopping until I reached the telegraph
office.</p>

<p>"It was little wonder that I made strange mistakes
during the hour that followed.</p>

<p>"It was during this time that Mrs. May stepped up to
the window and called for a blank.</p>

<p>"Although her name was the same as mine, yet we
were in no way related to each other. They were
wealthy people from Boston, I had heard, and were summering
in the village.</p>

<p>"Without waiting to see the message sent, the lady hurried
out of the office. A great sigh broke from my lips as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
I noted the well-filled purse that she carried, the magnificent
diamonds she wore on her hands, and which
swung sparkling from her ears. Any one of the gems
she wore would have been a fortune to a poor girl like
me.</p>

<p>"As she crossed the railway track in the direction of
the post office, she must have seen the train bearing down
upon her from around the curve of the road.</p>

<p>"However, she fainted away from fright, and lay
directly on the track. I had seen it all from my window,
and I sprung to her rescue and dragged her by main
force from the track just in time to save her from destruction,
as the ponderous locomotive just then thundered
by. Mrs. May's gratitude was great when she recovered
consciousness.</p>

<p>"'How shall I ever reward you, my good girl?' she
cried.</p>

<p>"'I need no reward,' I answered. 'I would have done
that for any one!'</p>

<p>"'You must be rewarded,' she declared. 'My husband
is coming from Boston to-night, and he will insist
upon doing handsomely by you.'</p>

<p>"I was living at home with my poor old mother, and
when I went home that evening and told her the story,
she wept like a child.</p>

<p>"'You did a noble action, Ida,' she said; adding
slowly: 'The Mays are very rich. I should not be surprised
if they made you a handsome present. I once
knew a gentleman who gave a lad twenty-five dollars for
saving his son from drowning. Perhaps they may do as
well by you.'</p>

<p>"You see, we were very poor&mdash;mother and I&mdash;and
twenty-five dollars seemed a great deal to us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"'How much good we could do with that sum,' my
mother said. 'We could get a little ahead in our rent,
and spare enough out of it to get a new dress for you.'</p>

<p>"I clasped my hands. A new dress! Oh, surely it
would be madness to hope for such a thing!</p>

<p>"That evening Mrs. May sent for me to come to the
grand cottage where she was stopping. Her husband, a
very deaf old gentleman, sat at the window as I entered.
They both thanked me in the most eager and grateful
fashion.</p>

<p>"'We have been thinking the matter over,' said Mrs.
May, 'and I have come to the conclusion that I will do
something handsome for you&mdash;give you a pleasure such
as you have never experienced in your young life.'"</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>


<p>"Mrs. May paused and looked smilingly at me for a
moment or two.</p>

<p>"'So great is the treat I have in store for you that you
will never forget it. But Mr. May and I disagree slightly
as to what it shall be. We now lay the proposition before
you. Which would you prefer&mdash;have five hundred dollars
in cash, or be taken to Newport for a season, have lovely
dresses, and stop at a great hotel, under <i>my</i> protection,
and have as fine a time as any young girl at the sea-shore?'</p>

<p>"I cried aloud in the exuberance of my joy. I had
read of the lives of other young girls at the sea-shore,
and this opportunity seemed like the opening out of
fairy-land to me. You will not blame me, Royal; I was
young and romantic. I had never seen anything of life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
or its pleasures. A season at Newport! The very
thought of it fairly took away my breath.</p>

<p>"'Oh, I will go to Newport!' I cried. 'Then the
great dream of my life will be realized!'</p>

<p>"'My husband thought you would prefer the money,
but I knew that you would prefer the pleasure.'</p>

<p>"Half wild with joy, I went home and told my mother
the wonderful news. She shook her head sadly.</p>

<p>"'We are so poor, you should have chosen the money,
Ida,' she sobbed. 'Such a great gift is offered you but
once in a life-time!'</p>

<p>"'But what does Mrs. May want you to do for her,
Ida? Are you to be her maid?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, no, mother!' I cried, with a hysterical laugh.
'I am to be a real lady, wear fine clothes, and sit on the
porch reading novels, or promenade on the sea-shore,
from the time I get up in the morning till I retire at night.
I shall have pin-money, too, they say, and that I will send
home to you. So everything will go on with you while I
am away as it did while I was here.'</p>

<p>"We had never been parted from each other, mother
and I, and oh! it wrung her heart to say 'Yes.'</p>

<p>"But after much pleading on my part she consented
to let me go. She made one proviso, however, and that
was&mdash;I was not to fall in love with any one whom I
might meet.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can not tell you of my delight when I saw the
wonderful dresses that Mrs. May purchased for me,
saying that they were all my own forever after. She
took me to Newport with her. As my name was the
same as theirs, every one took it for granted that I was
a niece of theirs, instead of their <i>protge</i> for a few short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
weeks, a report which the Mays did not trouble themselves
to contradict."</p>

<p>She had told her story hastily, impetuously, not daring
to look into her lover's face until she had concluded.
Then she raised her great dark eyes slowly. But what
she saw in her husband's face made her cry out in terror.</p>

<p>"Oh, Royal! Royal! what is the matter?" she cried,
in alarm.</p>

<p>He sat before her as though he were petrified. The
glassy, horrified stare in his eyes cut to her heart like the
thrust of a sword.</p>

<p>"I married you for love. You have helped me to escape
Mrs. Deering's dreaded nephew," she faltered.</p>

<p>By a wonderful effort he found his voice.</p>

<p>"Not the heiress of the Mays!" he cried, hoarsely, as
though he was unable to realize the truth.</p>

<p>"You do not love me the less for what I have done,
do you?" she cried, catching her breath with a sharp
sob.</p>

<p>Before he could find words to answer, breakfast was
announced.</p>

<p>"Go in and eat your breakfast, Ida," he said. "I
have some important matters which I must attend to that
will keep me busy for the next hour to come. Don't wait
for me. Lie down and rest until you hear from me.
You will need all your strength to meet that which is
before you." And his brows darkened ominously.</p>

<p>She was young, and youth has an appetite all its own.
She was very tired with all she had gone through the
last few hours, and the appetizing breakfast spread before
her caused her to forget everything else.</p>

<p>Like all young, healthy girls, she ate heartily; then
she rose from the table and re-entered the little parlor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
to wait for the coming of Royal to ask him to send a
telegram to her mother.</p>

<p>"Shall I show you to your room, miss?" asked the
waiter.</p>

<p>"No," she answered. "I will wait here."</p>

<p>"Then here is a letter which has just been handed me
to give to you."</p>

<p>She opened it, and found that it was from Royal.</p>

<p>For one moment Ida May looked with an expression
of puzzled wonder at the letter which the hotel waiter
had handed her.</p>

<p>It was in Royal's handwriting; she saw that at once.</p>

<p>What could he write to her about, when he had been
away from her scarcely an hour? He probably wished
to remind her to be sure to be ready when he arrived.</p>

<p>"How he loves me!" she murmured, a pink flush stealing
into the dimpled cheeks. "What a happy girl I
ought to be that my lover loves me so well!"</p>

<p>The waiter had gone back to attend to his duty. She
saw that she was alone, and with a quick action she
raised the envelope to her lips with her little white
hands and kissed it&mdash;ay, kissed passionately the sword
which was to slay her the next moment.</p>

<p>Seating herself in a cozy arm-chair close by the open
window, Ida May opened the letter which was to be her
death-warrant, and read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">"<span class="smcap">Ida</span>, I suppose the contents of this note will give you
something of a shock; but it is best to know the truth
now than later on. I shall come to the point at once, that
you may not be kept in suspense.</p>

<p>"The truth is, Ida, that your confession has knocked
all our little plans on the head. To write plainly, when
I thoughtlessly married you, it was under the impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
that you were the niece of the Mays&mdash;their future heiress.
I have not told you much about myself in the past, but I
am obliged to do so now.</p>

<p>"I am not at all a rich fellow. I am working along
as best I can, living on what people call wits&mdash;and expectations,
which make me a veritable slave to the whims of
a capricious old aunt and uncle.</p>

<p>"They have decided that I must marry a girl who has
money. I would not dare to present a portionless bride
to them. In such a case, all my future prospects would
be ruined. I must add that I have a still greater surprise
for you. On leaving you, I purchased this morning's
paper, and the first item that met my eye was the absconding
of the man who performed the ceremony for
us last night. It appears that he was turned out of office
some two days before, impeached, as it were, for embezzling
money.</p>

<p>"All power was taken from him to act in the capacity
of mayor. Thus the ceremony which we thought made
us one is not binding. You are free as air. No one will
be any the wiser, and you are none the worse for our little
escapade&mdash;romance&mdash;call it what you will.</p>

<p>"A little affair in the life of a telegraph operator will
not set the heart of the great world throbbing with excitement.
I am sorry affairs have turned out this way;
for, upon my word, I could have liked you. There is but
one thing to do under the circumstances; that is, to part
company. I advise you to go quietly back and marry the
rich lover Mrs. Deering has selected for you. That will
be better than drudging your life away in a telegraph
office.</p>

<p>"This is all I have to say, and thus I take French leave
of you. Forget me as quickly as you can, little girl. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
am nearly dead broke, but I am generous enough to share
what money I have with you. Inclosed you will find a
twenty-dollar bill&mdash;quite enough to take you back to the
village which you should never have left. Yours in great
haste,</p>


<p style="text-align: right; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">"'<span class="smcap">Royal</span>.'"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once, twice, thrice&mdash;ay, a dozen times&mdash;the girl read
the heartless letter through until every word was scorched
into her brain in letters of fire, then it fluttered from her
hands to the floor.</p>

<p>She sat quite still, like one petrified by a sudden awful
horror; then creeping to the window, she raised the sash,
and, looking up into God's face through the glinting sunshine,
asked the angels in Heaven to tell her if it was
true that the husband she had but just wedded had deserted
her.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>


<p>Again the poor child picked up the cruel letter; but
she could not read a line of it, though she sat looking
at the written page.</p>

<p>"Not his wife!" she moaned over and over again,
clutching her little hands over her heart.</p>

<p>With a sudden frenzy she tore the letter into a thousand
shreds, and flung the pieces from her through the
open window.</p>

<p>Would her poor, sick mother's heart break when she
told her all? When she went home, would they force
her to marry the terrible being she abhorred?</p>

<p>Home! Ah, God! what a mockery! She had only
a shelter. If she refused to marry the horrible hunchback,
her mother and herself would not even have that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>How could she face the future? The very thought
of it made the blood chill in her veins.</p>

<p>"Oh, Royal! Royal! death from your hands would
have been easier than that!" she moaned.</p>

<p>The next moment there was a heavy fall, and one of
the house-maids, passing the parlor, saw the girl lying
in a heap.</p>

<p>They did all in their power to restore her to consciousness;
but it was quite useless. When they had
worked an hour over her, they became alarmed.</p>

<p>Where was her husband? Why did he not return?
The hotel physician did all in his power, but without
avail.</p>

<p>"It looks like a case of brain fever," he said, "or
perhaps typhoid. Either is contagious, therefore dangerous.
I should advise that she be sent to the hospital
around the corner."</p>

<p>"That husband of hers has not settled his bill!"
exclaimed the proprietor, his face darkening angrily.</p>

<p>"It is <i>my</i> opinion," said the doctor, "that it is best
not to await the return of the young gentleman who
accompanied her here. In short, it is my opinion that
he has deserted her."</p>

<p>In less time than it takes to tell it, poor, hapless Ida
May, the victim of such a cruel misfortune, and a
sadder fate yet to follow, was taken to the hospital.
The waning summer days drifted slowly by, and
autumn came with its dead, rustling leaves and sobbing
winds, before Ida May opened her eyes to consciousness
and turned them full upon the white-capped nurse bending
over her.</p>

<p>"Where is Royal?" she asked, faintly.</p>

<p>"You mean the young man who left you at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
hotel?" queried the nurse, who had heard the young
girl's sad story; adding: "He never came back to
inquire for you. He has deserted you. He did not
care whether or not the shock would kill you. If there
was ever a heartless scoundrel on the face of the earth,
he is that one!"</p>

<p>The lovely white young face never changed its pallor,
the dark eyes never left the grim countenance of the
nurse.</p>

<p>"I want to leave this place at once," said the girl,
attempting to rise from her cot.</p>

<p>"No, no; you must not do so!" exclaimed the nurse.
"It would be dangerous in your case."</p>

<p>"But I want my mother," moaned Ida, piteously.</p>

<p>When the nurse made her rounds an hour later, to
her great consternation she found that Cot 27 was
empty. The girl had flown! The most diligent search
through the city failed to elicit the slightest trace of
her whereabouts.</p>

<p>An hour later a little dark figure, ensconced in a
corner of the car, was whirling rapidly toward Dorchester.</p>

<p>She sat staring from the window with eyes that did
not see so intent was she with her own thoughts.</p>

<p>"I can not marry Mrs. Deering's nephew," she
sobbed, under her breath. "It would be easier for me
to die. But what shall I do to raise the money for
which they hold my poor mother a veritable slave!"</p>

<p>She clasped her hands in piteous entreaty; but the
soft, radiant moon and the golden stars to which she
raised her eyes so appealingly could find no answer
for her.</p>

<p>As the train slowed up at the station, she pulled her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
veil down closely. She hurriedly alighted and sped like
a storm-driven swallow up the village street and along
the high-road, until, almost out of breath, she reached
the Deerings' mansion. She stood transfixed for a
moment at the gate.</p>

<p>What was there about the place that caused such
a shudder to creep over her? What did the awful presentiment,
as of coming evil, mean that took possession
of her body and soul?</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>


<p>How weird the place looked, how gaunt and bare the
great oak-trees looked, looming up darkly against the
moonlit sky! The dead leaves rustled across her path
as she crept around to the rear door.</p>

<p>She looked up at her mother's window, and another
great chill crept over her. All was dark there. It had
always been her mother's custom to place her lamp on
the broad window-sill at night. Many a time it had
been her beacon-light in cutting across lots from the
station on evenings when she had been detained by
her work. How strange it was that the light was not
in the window to-night!</p>

<p>"Mother is not expecting me to-night," she said to
herself, "that is the reason it is not there."</p>

<p>But ah, how she missed it! How her heart had
yearned to behold it, with a yearning so great that
it had been the most intense pain. She lifted the latch
and entered tremblingly, hesitatingly. It had been
over two months since her mother had heard from her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
How had her patient, suffering mother lived through
it?</p>

<p>As she crossed the hall she heard the sound of Mrs.
Deering's voice in a sharp, high key. Perhaps the
horrible nephew was with her. She paused in a
paroxysm of terror. She was talking to her husband,
scolding him, rather.</p>

<p>"It isn't <i>my</i> fault that we lost the fortune," he was
answering her meekly. "You brought your nephew
out of the asylum too soon. You knew he would not
be here a fortnight before he would do some terrible
deed&mdash;burn the house down over our heads, or kill
himself when the attendant was not watching, or some
other horrible deed of that kind. When he did succeed
in mutilating himself before any of us was aware of it,
instead of sending him back to the asylum, to be cared
for, you kept him here under lock and key thinking to
cure him yourself in a couple of months or so."</p>

<p>"Ah!" thought Ida May, leaning faint and dizzy
against the wall, "now I understand why Mrs. Deering
consented to let me go away. Anything to get me out
of the house while she was curing the insane nephew
whom she had vowed I must wed."</p>

<p>The next words, while they shocked her inexpressively,
lifted a world of woe from her heart.</p>

<p>"Well, despite our watchfulness, he succeeded in killing
himself at last; so there's the end of it. The fortune
is lost, and there's no use in raving over it, and in
venting your bitter wrath upon everything and every
one that comes within your range."</p>

<p>Mrs. Deering's anger was so great that she could not
utter a word. She flung open the door and dashed into
the hall. The very first object that met her gaze was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the cowering little figure leaning against the balustrade.</p>

<p>"You!" she cried, quite as soon as she could catch
her breath. "How dare you come here, Ida May, you
wicked girl! I am amazed that you have the effrontery
to face honest people after what you have done! We
read all about it in the newspapers&mdash;how you ran away
from Newport with a gay, dashing fellow who soon after
deserted you. Don't attempt to tell me anything about
it. I won't listen to a word. Get out of this house as
quick as you can! Go, before I bid the servants throw
you from the house!"</p>

<p>"But my mother! Surely you will let me see my
mother!" sobbed the girl, piteously. "The whole wide
world may be against me, but she will believe me guiltless!
<i>Please</i> let me see her."</p>

<p>A laugh that was horrible to hear broke from Mrs.
Deering's thin lips.</p>

<p>"Your mother!" she sneered; "much you cared about
her, or how your doings affected her. That article in
the newspapers did the work, as you might have known
it would. I carried the paper to her myself, and when
she read it she fell to the floor with a bitter cry, and she
never spoke again. It was her death-warrant!"</p>

<p>For one moment the girl looked at the woman with
frightened eyes, as though she could not quite comprehend
the full import of what the woman was saying.</p>

<p>"It killed your mother!" she repeated pitilessly.
"You might have known it would. She died of a
broken heart!"</p>

<p>A long, low moan came from the girl's lips. The
awful despair in the dark eyes would have touched
any other heart, even though it were made of stone; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
in Mrs. Deering's heart there was neither pity nor
mercy.</p>

<p>"Go!" she repeated, threateningly, "and do not dare
to ever darken my door again!"</p>

<p>"Will you tell me where you have buried my poor
mother?" moaned Ida May, with bitter anguish.</p>

<p>"In the lot where the poor of the village are put,"
she answered, unfeelingly. "We had to have a mark
put over her. You can easily find it. It's to the left-hand
corner, the last one on the row. It would be
better for you, you shameless girl, if you were lying
beside her rather than sink to the lowest depths of the
road you are traveling. Go&mdash;go at once!"</p>

<p>With trembling feet she crept down the broad path
and out of the gate. She was drenched to the skin, and
the chill October winds pierced through her thin wet
clothes like the sharp cut of a knife. It did not matter
much; nothing mattered for her any more. She was
going to find her mother's grave, kneel down beside it,
lay her tired head on the little green mound, and wait
there for death to come to her, for surely God would
grant her prayer and in pity reach out His hand to her
and take her home. There would be a home <i>there</i>
where her mother was, even if all other doors were
closed to her.</p>

<p>She had little difficulty in finding the place&mdash;a small
inclosure in the rear of the old church that had fallen
into decay and crumbling ruins many years ago&mdash;and
by the blinding flashes of lightning, she found the
grave of her mother&mdash;her poor, suffering mother, the
only being who had ever loved her in the great, cold,
desolate earth.</p>

<p>"Mother," she sobbed, laying her face on the cold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
wet leaves that covered the mound, "mother, I have
come to you to die. The world has gone all wrong
with me. I never meant to go wrong. I do not know
how it happened. Other young girls have married the
lovers whom they thought God had sent to them, and
lived happy enough lives. I built such glorious air-castles
of the home I should have, the handsome, strong
young husband to love and to labor for me, and how
you should live with me, mother, never having to work
any more. But oh, mother, all my plans went wrong!
I don't know why."</p>

<p>Ida May crouched there among the sleeping dead,
her brain in a whirl; and the long night wore on. The
storm subsided, the wind died away over the tossing
trees and the far-off hills, and the rain ceased. Morning
broke faint and gray in the eastern sky, and the
flecks of crimson along the horizon presaged a bright
and gladsome day.</p>

<p>The station-agent, hurrying along to his duties at
that early hour, was startled to see a dark figure lying
among the graves. In a moment he was bending over
the prostrate form. He could not distinguish in the
dim light whose grave it was upon which the poor
creature was lying, but as he lifted the slender figure,
and the faint, early light fell upon the white, beautiful
young face, he started back with an exclamation of
horror.</p>

<p>"Great God! it is little Ida May!"</p>

<p>For an instant he was incapable of action, his surprise
was so intense.</p>

<p>"Dead!" he muttered, cold drops of perspiration
standing out like beads on his perturbed brow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
"Little Ida May dead on her mother's grave! God,
how pitiful! She was so young to die!"</p>

<p>Then he knelt down beside her in the thick, wet
grass, and placed his hand over her heart in the wild
hope that a spark of life might yet be there.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>


<p>With bated breath, Hugh Rowland, the station-agent,
knelt down in the dew-wet grass, and placed his hand
over the girl's heart. Although the sweet white face
upturned to the gray morning light was as white as
death, he cried out sharply to himself: "Her heart still
beats! God be praised! There is life in her yet!"</p>

<p>Gathering her in his arms, as though she were a
little child, he carried her quickly across lots to the
station, and placed her upon a rude bench. Once there,
he could control himself no longer. He dropped upon
his knees beside her, burying his face in the folds of
her wet dress, chafing her hands, and sobbing as though
his heart would break.</p>

<p>He had loved the girl lying there so stark and
motionless as he had never loved anything in his life
before; but he had never dared to tell her of it.
Though he was station-agent, and she a telegraph
operator, she seemed as far above him as the star is
from the earth.</p>

<p>For a moment Hugh Rowland had almost lost control
of himself; then he remembered how horribly cold
she was, and he had the presence of mind to start a fire
in the big stove that always stood in the center of the
waiting-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>The grateful heat that rose from it quickly brought
the breath of life to the girl's white lips. The great,
dark, somber eyes opened wide, and she saw the rugged,
kindly face of the young station-agent bending over
her.</p>

<p>"I found you&mdash;you had fainted in the graveyard,"
he said. "Luckily enough, I was just passing, and I
brought you here."</p>

<p>"Oh, why didn't you let me die?" moaned the girl,
so bitterly that he was shocked.</p>

<p>"It is very wicked to talk like that," he said, forcing
down the great lump that rose in his throat.</p>

<p>"No!" she cried, vehemently. "How could it be
very wrong to leave a great, cold, cruel world in which
nobody wants you. I have nothing to live for."</p>

<p>"But somebody does want you, Ida May!" cried the
great rough fellow, with tears that were no disgrace
to his manhood coursing down his cheek. "I want
you with all my heart!"</p>

<p>"Hush, hush, hush!" she cried; "you must not talk
so to me!" she cried. "Don't say any more! It can
never be! You do not know all!"</p>

<p>"Do not say me nay. Give me the right to protect
you, Ida. We can go away from this village. I can
get a job on the road anywhere along the line. I will
work for you, and tend to you so very carefully that
you will forget the past!"</p>

<p>She only turned away from him, pleading with him
for the love of Heaven to say no more. He stopped
short, looking at her gloomily. He had used all the
words that he could command, and they had been of no
avail. She would not even listen.</p>

<p>"One moment more!" he cried, hoarsely. "Always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
remember, Ida May, that you leave behind you a heart
that beats only for you&mdash;only for you. No other
woman's face shall ever win my love from you. I will
wait here, where you leave me, for long years, until you
come back to me&mdash;ay, I will wait from day to day with
this one hope in my heart: Some day she will come
back to me; she will find the world too cold and hard,
and will come back to me to comfort her. I will watch
for you from darkness until day dawns again. My
form, so straight now, may grow bent with years, my
hair grow white, and lines seam my face, but through
it all I shall watch for your coming until God rewards
my vigilance. Good-bye, and God bless you, Ida May,
oh love of my heart!"</p>

<p>She passed from his sight with those words ringing
in her ears, and when the New York express passed on
again after she had boarded it, the young station-agent
fell prone upon his face to the floor, and lay there
like one dead.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>


<p>Few passengers turned to look at the little figure
that entered the car at the way-side station at so early
an hour of the morning, and Ida May cowered quickly
down into the first seat. The clothes under the long,
dark cloak were saturated, but no one could see that,
nor notice how damp and matted were the curling rings
of dark hair which the hood of the cloak but half concealed.
The hours crept on as the express whirled over
the rails; but Ida May paid no heed to time.</p>

<p>But hunger at last began to tell upon her, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
eagerly hailed a boy who passed through the train with
a basket of sandwiches on his arm.</p>

<p>She looked at the coins she still held loosely in her
hand, and found to her dismay that, with the exception
of two pieces of silver, she held a handful of gold
dollars.</p>

<p>"His pocket-pieces," she sobbed. "Oh, if I had
known that, I would have refused to take them; but&mdash;but
I will work and earn money, and&mdash;and pay him
back double their value. Poor fellow&mdash;poor fellow!"
and she laid her face on the window-sill, sobbing as
though her heart would break.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard a voice in the seat back of her
say:</p>

<p>"You seem very much distressed, poor girl. Is there
any way in which I can serve you?"</p>

<p>The deep, musical voice was so kind, so humane, so
sympathetic, that Ida May turned around with a start
to see who it was who had asked the question.</p>

<p>She saw directly back of her a fair, handsome young
man who had evidently just entered the car, and who
was depositing his grip-sack and umbrella in the rack
above his head.</p>

<p>At the first glance a faint shriek broke from her lips.
She was just about to cry out, "Royal Ainsley&mdash;great
Heaven!&mdash;do we meet again?" when she saw her error
in time. Although bearing a certain resemblance to the
lover who had so cruelly betrayed her, a second glance
told her it was not him.</p>

<p>It was a moment ere she recovered herself sufficiently
to answer, then she faltered, piteously:</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> in sorrow, sir, so great that I do not think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
any young girl but me could ever pass through it&mdash;and
live."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to pry into your private affairs,"
said the young man, courteously, "but I wish to repeat,
if you will tell me what troubles you, and I can be
of service to you, I shall be only too pleased. Although
a stranger, you will find me worthy of your confidence,
my poor child!"</p>

<p>There was something about the handsome, kindly,
blue-eyed young man that caused Ida May's heart to
go out to him at once. His was a face that women
always trusted, and no one had ever had cause to regret
it.</p>

<p>"I am going to New York in search of work," faltered
the girl, clasping her little hands closely together.</p>

<p>"That is certainly reason enough to weep," he
replied earnestly. "May I ask if you have friends
there to whom you are going until you can find employment?"</p>

<p>Ida May shook her head, her breast heaved, her
white lips quivered, while great tears welled up to the
great dark eyes, so like purple velvet pansies drowned
in rain.</p>

<p>"I have no friends&mdash;no one. I am all alone in the
world, sir," she sobbed. "My mother is dead&mdash;dead.
I have just left her grave. She and I were all in all
to each other; now she is gone, and I&mdash;Oh, only the
angels know that no sorrow is so bleak, so pitiful, so
awful, as to be all alone in the world."</p>

<p>"I can understand the situation perfectly," he
answered in a low voice, "and I can pity you. Although
not quite alone in the world myself, I am almost
as badly off. But to return to yourself: I may be able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
to serve you. What kind of employment were you intending
to search for? In some store, or dress-making
or millinery establishment?" he queried.</p>

<p>She looked blankly up into his fair, handsome,
earnest face.</p>

<p>"I do not know how to do anything of that kind,"
she answered, simply. "I thought perhaps I might find
employment in some telegraph office."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, indeed. I wonder that that idea did not
occur to me before. A friend of mine is superintendent
of a large branch of the Western Union, up Broadway.
I will give you a note to him, and I have no doubt he
will do all in his power to aid you, providing he has a
vacancy."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you a thousand times, sir," cried Ida
May, thankfully; "I shall be so grateful&mdash;oh, so very
grateful!"</p>

<p>"Mind, it is not a certainty, you know," admonished
the stranger earnestly; "I can only write the letter.
But that is not assuring you of a situation&mdash;we can
only hope for it."</p>

<p>He tore out a leaf from his memorandum, and taking
a gold pencil from his vest pocket, hastily jotted down
a few lines upon it.</p>

<p>"I am sorry I am not going through to New York;
otherwise I would take you there myself," he said,
courteously, as he folded up the note and handed it to
her.</p>

<p>At that moment his station was reached. He had
barely time to touch his hat to her, gather up his parcels,
and alight, ere the train moved out again. The
young man looked after it and the sweet, tearful young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
face pressed against one of the windows until it was
out of sight.</p>

<p>"By all that is wonderful!" he ejaculated in a very
troubled voice, "I am almost positive that I forgot to
sign my name to that note, and it was written so badly
on that jolting car, Ernscourt won't be able to make
it out or know whose writing it is. Poor little girl! I
hope she will find a position there. What a terrible
thing it is to be young and desolate in the great wicked
city of New York! She is so young, guileless and innocent,
I hope no ill will befall her. I must remember
to look up my friend Ernscourt to learn if he gave her
a position or not. I declare, if it were not that I am
betrothed to the sweetest girl in all the world, I am
afraid I should commit the desperate folly of falling
in love with that beautiful, dark-eyed little stranger.
Now that I think of it, it did not occur to me to even
ask her name or where she was from."</p>

<p>His reverie was somewhat rudely interrupted by a
hearty slap on the shoulder and a hearty voice calling
out gayly:</p>

<p>"Why, Royal, how are you, old fellow? What, in the
name of all that's amazing, brings you to Yonkers?"</p>

<p>"Why, Hal, is this you?" cried the other, in astonishment
and delight. "This is an additional pleasure,
meeting my old college chum fully a thousand miles
from where I would never have imagined finding him.
But a word in your ear, my dear boy: It's two years
since you and I parted at college, old fellow, and a
great deal has happened in that time. We will walk up
the street while I inform you."</p>

<p>"With the greatest of pleasure, Royal," returned
his companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tut! tut! Don't call me Royal&mdash;Royal Ainsley.
I'm that no longer, you know&mdash;no, I suppose you don't
know; but that's exactly what I want to talk to you
about."</p>

<p>"I am too astonished for utterance," declared his
friend.</p>

<p>"Why, the explanation is certainly simple enough,"
declared the other, with a good-natured, mellow little
laugh; adding: "Why, you, my college chum, knew
what many another friend of mine does <i>not</i> know,
namely, that there are two Royal Ainsleys, or, rather,
there was up to the present year. It's a bit of secret
family history; but I am obliged to take you into my
confidence, in order that you may fully understand my
most peculiar position. Two brothers, who were almost
enemies born, married about the same time, and
to each of the gentlemen&mdash;namely, my uncle and my
father, was born a son&mdash;my cousin and myself.</p>

<p>"These gentlemen had an eccentric elder brother who
had money to burn, as the saying is, and what should
each of these younger brothers do but name their sons
after the wealthy old Royal Ainsley, if you please, each
hoping that <i>his</i> son would be the old uncle's heir.</p>

<p>"A pretty mess these two belligerent gentlemen made
of the affair, I assure you. Two Royal Ainsleys, each
resembling the other to an unpleasantly startling
degree, of almost the same age, being born scarcely a
week apart.</p>

<p>"We were constantly getting into all manner of
scrapes, a case of being continually taken for the fellow
that looks like me, as the song goes. Each disputed
with the other the right to bear the name, and neither
would put a handle to it or do anything to cause it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
differ in any way from the cognomen of the famous old
uncle, who was certainly quite as bewildered as any
one else.</p>

<p>"As we two lads grew older, I took to books, my
cousin to sports and the pretty faces of girls. When
his folks died and he was left to follow the bent of his
own inclination, in spite of my earnest admonition and
my uncle's combined, he jumped the traces of home
restraint altogether, and started out to see life on his
own hook. The last I heard of him he was with some
distant relative, clerking in a New York importing
house.</p>

<p>"Now for <i>my</i> side of the story. From the hour he
defied uncle and shook off his restraint, old Royal
Ainsley's hatred of him grew so bitter we dared not
mention my wayward cousin, Royal Ainsley, in his
presence. My uncle actually forced me to change my
name through legislative enactment to make it legal.
He insisted upon naming me Eugene Mallard, declaring
that my cousin would be sure to disgrace the name of
Royal Ainsley through the length and breadth of the
land before he stopped in his mad downward career.</p>

<p>"Well, to make a long story short, my uncle sent me
to Europe on business for him, and his sudden death
brought me hurriedly home this week, to find that he
has left me his entire fortune, with the proviso that
not one dollar shall ever go to my cousin, who, in all
probability, does not yet know of his sad plight.</p>

<p>"Now, last but by no means least, on the steamer
coming back from London I met a beautiful young
girl, Miss Hildegarde Cramer. It was a case of love
at first sight between us. You know I'm a very impulsive
fellow. I proposed, and she accepted me on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
spot; but mind, she knows me as Eugene Mallard, and
so she shall know me to the end of her sweet life, bless
her.</p>

<p>"Now you know the whole story. Mind, I'm not
Royal Ainsley, but, instead, Eugene Mallard, at your
service.</p>

<p>"Hildegarde is visiting in Yonkers, so I ran up to see
my sweetheart. Sounds like a romance or a comedy,
doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"I hope there will be no tinge of tragedy in it,"
laughed his friend, thoughtlessly.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>


<p>With a note of introduction to the superintendent
clutched tightly in her hand, Ida May reached New
York City. She took barely time to swallow a cup of
coffee ere she hurried to the number indicated. Her
heart sunk within her as she looked up at the immense
building; but with a courage which should have met
with a better reward, she took the elevator, and soon
found herself on the eighth floor, where the superintendent's
office was situated.</p>

<p>"He is not in," an attendant told her. "He left the
city two days ago, and is not expected to return for a
fortnight."</p>

<p>Tears that she could not control sprung into Ida
May's dark eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, what shall I do?" cried the girl; "I want to
see him so much!"</p>

<p>The attendant was moved to pity by her great distress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you are looking for a position, or anything of
that kind, perhaps I could suggest something."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, that is it, sir," exclaimed Ida May, looking
up through her tears&mdash;"that is my errand. I want to
secure a position."</p>

<p>"Then it is the manager, instead of the superintendent,
you will have to apply to. I think he is in his
office. Step this way, please."</p>

<p>He threw open a door to the right, and Ida May followed
him into a large room, in which were dozens
of young girls bending over tables.</p>

<p>The deafening click! click! click! of the telegraph
instruments drowned every sound.</p>

<p>Some girls never raised their heads, as Ida May,
following the attendant, passed down the long aisle.
Others, however, glanced at her, at first casually,
which deepened instantly into a gaze of curiosity and
intense interest, for they had never beheld a creature
with such superb beauty. Their hearts beat with
envy.</p>

<p>"The manager will be sure to engage her," they
whispered. "Her pretty face will be sure to be a
passport to favor. There used to be a time when it
was 'How much do you know about the business?'
but now it is 'What kind of a face have you? If it's
a pretty and dashing one, I'll engage you.' An old
or a homely girl doesn't stand any show whatever
nowadays."</p>

<p>All unconscious of these remarks, Ida May passed
on. The attendant threw open another door at the
end of a large room, and she found herself in a luxuriously
furnished office. A young and exceedingly
handsome man sat at a desk writing. He glanced up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
angrily at the sound of footsteps, and was about to
make a sharp remark to the man, when he caught sight
of the beautiful young creature he was ushering into
his presence.</p>

<p>"Ah, sit down," he said, blandly; "I will attend
to you in one moment."</p>

<p>The attendant had scarcely closed the door behind
him ere the manager&mdash;for such he proved to be&mdash;turned
quickly about and faced the young girl.</p>

<p>"What can I do for you?" he said in his blandest
voice. He had taken in at first glance the wondrous
beauty of the young girl. It was certainly the most
exquisite face he had ever beheld, and a strange gleam
leaped into his eyes. He told himself that, from her
appearance, she had certainly come in search of a
position. Ida May looked up into the dark, handsome
face. Instinctively she shrunk from him, but
could not tell why. Very timidly she stated her
errand, the color on her face deepening, as she could
not help but notice the ardent glance of admiration he
bent upon her, and there was something in the bold
glance of his eyes that made her feel extremely uncomfortable.</p>

<p>In a falteringly voice Ida stated her errand, and
what experience she had had in her little village home.
To her great delight and surprise, he answered
quickly:</p>

<p>"I think I will be able to make a place for you. It
would be a pity to send away such a pretty girl as
you are."</p>

<p>Ida May drew back in alarm. She did not like the
remark, nor the look which accompanied it; but she
dared not make an indignant reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where are you stopping?" he asked in the next
breath.</p>

<p>"I have just reached the city, sir," she responded.
"I came in search of a position even before I found a
place to stop."</p>

<p>"It is well you did so," he responded quickly. "I
know of a place that I think will suit you. The lady
has no other boarders. You would be company for
her. I would make this observation here and now: the
girls we have here are a talkative set. Pay no attention
to their remarks."</p>

<p>He wrote an address on a slip of paper, and handed
it to the girl.</p>

<p>"I am very grateful, sir, for the interest you have
taken in me, a poor girl," she said, tremulously. "Shall
I report to-day for work, sir?" she asked. "I should
like to commence as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"To-morrow will do," he answered.</p>

<p>With a heart full of thanks, she left the office.</p>

<p>Frank Garrick, the manager, looked after her with
a smile that was not pleasant to see.</p>

<p>"I have run across many a little beauty in my time,"
he muttered, gazing after her, "but surely never such
an exquisite little beauty as this one."</p>

<p>The girls looked at one another, nodding grimly,
when Ida May presented herself for duty the next day.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you how it would be?" sneered one
of the girls. "Our handsome manager, Mr. Garrick,
was captivated by the girl's beauty, as I knew he
would be, and engaged her, although he refused to
take on, only the day before, three girls whom I knew
to be actually starving."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>There was one girl who looked at Ida May with
darkening eyes.</p>

<p>She bent over her task; but though the hours passed,
the terrible look never left her face.</p>

<p>"Nannie is jealous," more than one girl whispered
to her neighbor. "You see, she's head over heels in
love with our manager. If he so much as looks at any
other girl that passes along, she sulks for a week. What
fun it would be to make her jealous. Oh, let's try,
girls! Let's put up a job on her. It would be such
fun!"</p>

<p>"Not for the new-comer!" laughed another girl.</p>

<p>"Nannie would make it pretty hot for her here."</p>

<p>Little dreaming of the tempest they were stirring up,
the girls thoughtlessly planned their little joke. Their
shouts of laughter would have been turned into tears of
pity could they have beheld the harvest of woe that
was to spring from it.</p>

<p>Nannie Rogers noticed that the beautiful new-comer
was assigned to an instrument at a table almost directly
opposite the private office. This inflamed the jealously
of Nannie Rogers.</p>

<p>She noted how he watched her from the window of
his office all the next day.</p>

<p>More than one girl called Nannie Rogers' attention
to this at noon-hour.</p>

<p>"You will have to look to your laurels, Nan," more
than one declared, banteringly. "You will find this
Ida May a rival, I fear."</p>

<p>"Any girl had better be dead than attempt to be a
rival of mine," she answered.</p>

<p>There came a time when the girls remembered that
remark all too forcibly.</p>

<p>Ida May bent over her task, paying little attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
to anything around her. She was trying to forget her
double sorrow, all that she had gone through, and the
death of her poor mother that had followed.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>


<p>Ida May had found no difficulty whatever in securing
board at the place where Frank Garrick had suggested.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cole, who owned the cottage, told Ida that she
was a widow.</p>

<p>"I have a little income that keeps me comfortable,"
she added; "but to accommodate my friend, Mr. Garrick,
I will take you in."</p>

<p>"He is a friend of yours?" exclaimed the girl.</p>

<p>"Yes; I used to be in the telegraph office before I
married," she responded. "In fact, my husband and
Mr. Garrick were both paying attention to me at the
same time. To be candid, I liked Mr. Garrick the
better; but we had a little misunderstanding, and
through pique I married his rival. I lost sight of him
after that until my husband died. After I became a
widow he called upon me several times."</p>

<p>She gave the impression to Ida that she expected a
proposal from her old lover some time in the near
future, but the girl paid little heed to the blushing
widow. Her thoughts were elsewhere.</p>

<p>One evening, at the end of the second week, as Ida
was hurrying homeward, she was startled by a step
behind her.</p>

<p>"You seem to be in a hurry, Miss May," a voice
said; and turning quickly around, she beheld the handsome
manager, Mr. Garrick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> in a hurry!" she assented. "I am a little
late now, and Mrs. Cole does not like me to keep
supper waiting."</p>

<p>"Never mind what she likes," he returned, impatiently.
"Let us take a little walk, I have something
to say to you, pretty one."</p>

<p>There was something in his eyes, his voice, that somehow
startled her.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, but I do not care to walk," she said,
simply, with the haughty air of a young princess.</p>

<p>"Don't put on airs," he said, harshly; "you are not
very wise to try to snub a manager who has the power
to turn you out of your position at any moment."</p>

<p>Ida grew frightfully pale.</p>

<p>"Come, let us take a little walk," he urged. "You're
a very pretty girl, and I like you."</p>

<p>Ida May drew back with an exclamation of alarm.</p>

<p>"I refuse to walk with you!" she said.</p>

<p>"Don't make an enemy of me, Ida May!" he hissed
between his teeth.</p>

<p>"If such a trifle will make an enemy, I would rather
make an enemy than a friend of you!" she answered.</p>

<p>"Are you mad, girl, to defy me like this?" he cried,
setting his white teeth together, his eyes fairly blazing.</p>

<p>"I have no wish to defy you! I can not see why my
refusing to walk with you should offend you!"</p>

<p>"Come, be reasonable," he urged; "let us have a
little quiet talk. I have called at your boarding-house
half a dozen times since you have been there, but that
idiotic fool, who is half in love with me herself, would
not let me see you. I might have known how it would
be: I'll look for another boarding-place at once for
you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The interest he took in her alarmed her.</p>

<p>"I am very well satisfied where I am, Mr. Garrick,"
she answered, with dignity. "I beg that you will not
call upon me, for I do not care to receive gentlemen
callers."</p>

<p>Again a rage that was terrible to see flashed into his
eyes.</p>

<p>"You <i>must</i> see me!" he hissed. "It is not for you
to be chooser. Don't you see I have taken a fancy to
you," he said, throwing off all reserve. "You must be
mine! I never really knew what love meant until I
saw you!"</p>

<p>"Stop! Stop!" panted Ida May. "I will not listen
to another word. You must not talk to me of love!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I loved you, Ida May, from the first time I saw
you. There was something about you which thrilled
my heart and caused me to wish that you should be
mine, cost what it would!"</p>

<p>"I will not listen to another word!" said Ida May.</p>

<p>He laughed an insolent laugh that made the blood
fairly boil in her veins.</p>

<p>"Come, we will go into this restaurant where we can
talk at our leisure."</p>

<p>He had caught her by the arm. With a cry of terror
the girl wrenched herself free from his grasp and fairly
flew down the street, and she did not stop until she
reached her boarding-house.</p>

<p>"Why, dear me, Miss May, one would think you were
flying from a cyclone!" declared Mrs. Cole, who was
just passing through the hall as she came in.</p>

<p>Gasping for breath, and scarcely able to keep from
tears, Ida May told her all, believing that the woman
would sympathize with her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, you are more of a prude than I thought you
were," said Mrs. Cole.</p>

<p>Ida May drew back with dilated eyes.</p>

<p>"You, a woman, to tell me this! Why, I tell you he
was insulting me!" cried the girl, vehemently.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cole laughed cynically.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" she declared. "You might do worse
than accept his attentions. He's over head and heels
in love with you. I could have told you that a week
ago."</p>

<p>"He is a bold, bad man!" cried Ida May. "And yet
you would counsel me to encourage him wouldn't
you?"</p>

<p>The elder woman shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Any one could easily see that you are a country
girl," she said, with a harsh laugh that grated on the
girl who listened with amazement.</p>

<p>With this parting shot the woman turned on her
heel and left Ida May staring after her.</p>

<p>To Ida's intense anxiety, her landlady was unusually
cool at the tea-table. She did not come up to
Ida May's room that evening to chat, but announced
that she had a headache, needed quiet, and would stay
in her own room. Her presence during the long evenings
had done much toward making the girl forget her
sorrow, and she felt her absence keenly enough on this
night when she had so much need of sympathy.</p>

<p>Feeling too restless to commune with her own
thoughts, she concluded to read a book to fill in the
time that hung so heavily on her hands.</p>

<p>Ida May descended to the sitting-room, where, she
remembered, she had left the book on the table. She
went down the carpeted stairs quietly, passing Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Cole's door with noiseless feet, that she might not disturb
her.</p>

<p>As she stood before the door of the sitting-room, with
her hand on the knob, she was suddenly attracted by
the sound of voices from within, her own name falling
distinctly upon her ears. She stood still with astonishment,
for the voice that uttered her name was that
of Frank Garrick.</p>

<p>Her first impulse was to turn quickly away; but the
words that she heard him utter held her spell-bound.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrick was talking to Mrs. Cole in a low, excited
voice, and what the girl heard filled her soul with
wildest terror.</p>

<p>For a moment she stood irresolute; then her decision
was made. As soon as the morning broke, she would
leave that house.</p>

<p>She flew back to her room, her mind in a whirl, her
brain dizzy with conflicting emotions. She sat down
in a chair by the open window, and leaned her hot,
flushed face in the palms of her hands. She was beginning
to learn the lessons of the great, wicked world.
How long she sat there she never knew.</p>

<p>She was planning about what she should do when the
morrow came. Though she starved on the street, she
would not go back to the telegraph office where Frank
Garrick was; nor could she remain in the house that
now sheltered her, where the woman who pretended to
be her friend and counselor was deliberately plotting
against her.</p>

<p>She had purchased a dress, cloak, and hat out of the
money she had found in her pocket. This expenditure
had reduced the little sum considerably; but she had
been obliged to present a respectable appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Where should she look for work in the great big
city? While she was cogitating over the matter, Mrs.
Cole appeared in the door-way with a glass of lemonade
in her hand.</p>

<p>"I have brought you something very refreshing,
Ida," she said. "It took away <i>my</i> headache, and it
will make you enjoy a good night's sleep."</p>

<p>"Thank you, but I do not care for the lemonade,"
returned the girl, coldly.</p>

<p>Her first impulse had been to spring to her feet,
and inform her that she had accidently overheard her
conversation with Frank Garrick, and upbraid her for
it in the bitterest of words. Then the thought occurred
to her that discretion was the better part of valor&mdash;to
say nothing, and leave the house quietly in the
morning.</p>

<p>"But I insist upon your drinking the lemonade," declared
the young widow.</p>

<p>Ida looked at her steadily, and something in the reproachful
glance of the girl's eyes made her wince.
The hand that held the glass shook in spite of her
efforts at composure.</p>

<p>"It will induce an excellent night's sleep, my dear,"
said Mrs. Cole, smoothly. "Stir it up; you are letting
all the sugar settle at the bottom."</p>

<p>"I do not care for it," repeated Ida, a trifle more
haughtily.</p>

<p>"But as it is for your good, you <i>must</i> drink it!" repeated
her companion. "I shall not leave the room
until you do so."</p>

<p>At that moment Katie, the little maid of all work,
entered the room with towels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Passing near the back of her chair, she managed to
whisper in her ear, unobserved by Mrs. Cole:</p>

<p>"Promise her to drink the lemonade if she will leave
it on the table; but don't touch a drop of it. I'll tell
you why later."</p>

<p>The remark was accompanied by a warning glance
from the girl's eyes. Laying down the towels, Katie
retreated to the door; but the warning look that she
cast back at her aroused Ida May.</p>

<p>"Set the glass down, and I will drink the lemonade
later on," she said, quietly.</p>

<p>"Do you promise me that you will?" said Mrs. Cole,
with unusual interest.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ida, hesitatingly. "Put it down on the
table."</p>

<p>"I will come back in ten minutes," declared Mrs.
Cole, "and if you have not drunk it by that time&mdash;well,
I'll make you, that's all," she added, with a
forced laugh, but meaning just what she said.</p>

<p>Ida May sat down when she found herself alone,
wondering in amazement what Katie could have meant
by her strange words. At that moment the girl glided
into the room.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>


<p>"Oh! do not touch it, my dear young lady!" cried
Katie, rushing into the room and seizing the lemonade
with hands that were trembling. "Listen, miss," she
cried in an awful whisper. "They put something into it&mdash;the
lemonade is drugged!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Ida May looked at her with the utmost astonishment.
She could scarcely understand her words.</p>

<p>"I saw them do it!" repeated the girl. "I heard him
say, 'Put in enough, and it will make her sleep soundly.'
It was a white powder he had brought with him," the
maid went on, excitedly. "Oh, he makes such a dupe
of my poor mistress! He has hypnotized her so that
she is afraid to say that her soul is her own. I heard
a great deal more that he said, but I can not tell you
now. All I can do is to warn you. Go away from here
as quickly as you can. They are enemies of yours,
both of them."</p>

<p>The girl's words terrified Ida May. She recalled
Frank Garrick's words as he walked along the street
beside her.</p>

<p>"Take care! beware, girl! You had better not make
an enemy of me! If you do, you will rue the hour! For
I can make it very unpleasant for you. Ay, you will
be sorry that you were ever born."</p>

<p>She <i>had</i> made an enemy of him, and now he was
about to take some terrible revenge upon her. She
did not have time to exchange another word with the
maid, for she had fled from the room as quickly as she
had entered it, and she was left alone with her conflicting
thoughts.</p>

<p>The window was open, and she threw the contents of
the glass out on the pavement below.</p>

<p>She had scarcely set it down, before Mrs. Cole glided
into the room.</p>

<p>"Ah! you have drunk the lemonade. That's right!"
she added in a triumphant tone. "But I won't sit down
to talk to you to-night; you look sleepy. I would advise
you to retire at once."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Ida looked at her steadily, remembering the startling
words that Katie had whispered in her ears. Was this
a woman or a fiend incarnate? Ida wondered.</p>

<p>Her footsteps had scarcely died away ere Ida took
down a long dark cloak, and hurriedly donning it, together
with her hat and veil, she gathered her effects
together, and thrusting them into a hand-bag, stole
silently as a shadow out into the darkened hall. As
she passed the sitting-room door she heard the sound of
voices.</p>

<p>Frank Garrick was still there.</p>

<p>In the shadow of the vestibule door she saw Katie
waiting for her.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, and God bless you, Ida May!" she said,
holding out her rough, toil-worn little hand.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, and thank you for the service you have
rendered me," she answered, with deep feeling. "If
we ever meet again, perhaps it may be in my power to
repay you," added Ida, the tears standing out on her
long lashes.</p>

<p>She little dreamed that the hour would come when
she would be called upon to remember that promise.</p>

<p>Out of the house she stole, out into the darkness of
the street.</p>

<p>At last, when faint and almost falling down from
exhaustion, she ran directly into the arms of a blue
coat who was leisurely passing a corner.</p>

<p>"Halloo there, my good girl!" he cried. "What are
you doing out at this hour of the night?"</p>

<p>Trembling piteously, and all unnerved at this unexpected
encounter, for a moment the girl was speechless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am trying to find shelter until to-morrow morning,
sir," she said. "Then I shall look for work."</p>

<p>But the officer would not parley with her. He grasped
her by the arm, and was forcing the sobbing girl along,
when he was suddenly confronted by a young man who
was passing, and who had witnessed the affair.</p>

<p>"Officer," he said, sternly, "this is an outrage. Why
do you not let that young girl go her way in peace?
Why do you molest her?"</p>

<p>"It's my duty to run in every girl who walks the
street at night, without a justifiable reason."</p>

<p>"Let <i>me</i> be responsible for this young woman," said
the man. "I believe what she told you to be true&mdash;that
she wants to find a place to stop until day-break,
and then she will look for work."</p>

<p>The officer recognized the young man at once.</p>

<p>"If <i>you</i> will vouch for her," he said, "why, she can
go her way, certainly."</p>

<p>"I think I'm a tolerably good judge of character,"
returned the young man, "and I see nothing in her
face to mistrust. Take her to one of the missions near
at hand. She can certainly stay there till morning."</p>

<p>The policeman made a low bow, and the young man
passed on.</p>

<p>"You have interested one of the richest young men
in New York in your behalf," said the policeman, after
they had passed on.</p>

<p>Ida did not ask the name of her benefactor, though
she felt deeply grateful for the kind service he had
rendered her.</p>

<p>The matron of the home for friendless girls received
the young girl with the kindliness that characterized
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>She assigned her a little cot, and, wretched and footsore,
Ida May threw herself upon it and sobbed herself
to sleep.</p>

<p>The matron looked at her as she passed through the
long dormitory on her way to her room.</p>

<p>"She has a sweet face!" she muttered, as she turned
away; "but one on which a tragedy is written."</p>

<p>Ida May was sitting in the reception-room when the
matron passed through it the next morning, and she
asked her if there was anything she could do for her.</p>

<p>"If you could only tell me, please, where I could
find something to do," she answered. "I must find
work, or&mdash;starve!"</p>

<p>"When do you wish to look for a situation?" asked
the matron, noting how wan and pale the girl looked.</p>

<p>"This day, this very hour!" cried Ida May, eagerly.</p>

<p>The matron hesitated.</p>

<p>"I must first know what sort of employment you are
seeking&mdash;what you are best suited for."</p>

<p>"I am suited for nothing," Ida answered, despondently.
"But that must not deter me. If one did only
the work one was fitted for, three-quarters of the world
would be idle."</p>

<p>"Would you take a situation as governess if one
could be found for you?"</p>

<p>She shook her head dejectedly.</p>

<p>"I have not education enough," she replied. "I did
not have much opportunity of going to school when I
was a little girl, and I am suffering for it now."</p>

<p>After a moment's pause the matron said, thoughtfully:</p>

<p>"Would you like to try dress-making?"</p>

<p>"That's another thing that I know nothing about,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
she said. "I was never taught to mend or sew. I
always got out of it. Mother did it for me rather than
scold me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would take a position as lady's-maid."</p>

<p>A gasp, a shiver passed over her. Quick as lightning
there flashed before her mind the humiliation of three
or four maids who had accompanied their mistresses to
the Ocean Hotel, at Newport, and how Lily Ryder and
Hildegarde Cramer had turned up their noses at them
because they had pretty faces, and had dared to pin
in a pretty ribbon or two in the lace caps they were
forced to wear on all occasions.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I wouldn't be a success at that," she
declared.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose you would like to be a house-maid,"
suggested the matron, looking at the small white hands
that lay in the girl's lap&mdash;the blue-veined hands that
were never designed to scour kettles or clean floors.
"My dear child," said the matron, compassionately,
"there is little else in a great city to do."</p>

<p>There was a pause&mdash;a pause broken presently by Ida
May.</p>

<p>"Don't you think that if I could get into one of those
large stores, I could try on cloaks and hats without requiring
any great amount of knowledge of any kind?"</p>

<p>The matron looked doubtful.</p>

<p>"It is not as easy as you may imagine, my dear, to
obtain admission into any of those large stores. They
have any amount of girls on their books who are waiting
eagerly for positions&mdash;persons with whom they are acquainted&mdash;and
they would stand a better chance than
a stranger. Besides, I hardly think a situation in a place
of that kind would be suitable for one so young. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
will look over the paper and read the advertisements."</p>

<p>She touched a bell, and told the attendant who answered
it to bring in the morning paper.</p>

<p>"You can look over it, my child," said the matron.
"I will return in half an hour. By that time you will
perhaps have found something that will suit you."</p>

<p>Left alone, Ida May commenced to look through the
"Want" columns.</p>

<p>All through sixteen columns of the paper the girl's
eyes eagerly ran. She did not find anything that she
was competent to do, and tears of vexation rolled down
her cheeks.</p>

<p>Suddenly her eyes rested upon an advertisement
which she must have missed in her hurried examination
of the column.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">"Wanted.&mdash;A few more hands in a cotton-mill. No.
&mdash; Canal Street. Applicants must apply between the
hours of nine and ten, this <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">Little dreaming of what was to come of it, Ida May
concluded that this was certainly the only position she
could dare apply for.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>


<p>The matron entered presently, and Ida May showed
her the advertisement that had attracted her attention.</p>

<p>"It might be as well to try that," said the matron,
encouragingly.</p>

<p>She looked after the girl as she went slowly down the
steps, and shook her head sadly.</p>

<p>As usual, Ida May's lovely face attracted the envy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of all the girls in the mill. The foreman, as well as the
clerks in the office, admired her, and that was enough to
make the girls detest her.</p>

<p>Ida had secured lodgings in a boarding-house where
a score of the girls stopped. She shared her room with
Emily Downs, a very quiet little thing, who had been a
general favorite with the girls up to this time.</p>

<p>Matters were going from bad to worse in the mill.
The girls gathered together in little groups here and
there, and looked darkly at Ida May. Even those who
were wont to say "good-night" or "good-morning"
passed her by without a word.</p>

<p>The comments of the jealous girls became louder and
deeper as another fortnight dragged its slow lengths
by. Whether Ida May heard or heeded them, they did
not care to know. The beautiful face grew whiter still,
and the large dark eyes became more pitiful in their
pathetic terror.</p>

<p>The girls gathered together one noon hour, and held a
long and excited conversation.</p>

<p>Ida and Emily Downs were eating their luncheon at
the further end of the room, quite apart by themselves.
Emily could see that something of an unusual order was
transpiring, by the girl's fierce gesticulations and the
angry glances that were cast upon her companion, who
seemed oblivious to it all.</p>

<p>At length one of them called Emily to them. There
was a whispered conversation, and looking mechanically
across the table at that moment, Ida May saw Emily
start back with a cry of horror.</p>

<p>"They are talking about me," thought Ida, crushing
back a sob. "They want to turn the only friend I
have from me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>She finished her simple luncheon in silence. It was
scarcely concluded ere she noticed with wonder that
the girls had formed a group and were marching over
in her direction in a body. There were fully fifty of
them, and Ida noticed with wonder that the face of
every one of them was white, set, and stern.</p>

<p>"Ida May," said the ringleader, harshly, "we have
something to say to you!"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, thinking that they had reconsidered
the matter, and were going to ask her to
join them.</p>

<p>For a moment the girl seemed at a loss to know
what to say, but the angry murmurs of her companions
in the rear nerved her to her task.</p>

<p>"After consultation, we have concluded that, as
respectable girls, we can not remain in the mills
another day if you are allowed to work here. You
must leave at once, or we shall do so."</p>

<p>For an instant Ida May was fairly dazed. She
scarcely believed that she had heard aright&mdash;surely
her senses were playing her false. She sprung to her
feet, and confronted the girls, who stood, with angered
faces, looking at her.</p>

<p>"Surely you can not mean what you say!" she
gasped. "What have I done that you should say this
to me?"</p>

<p>The ringleader looked at her with withering scorn.</p>

<p>"We do not consider you a proper companion to
mingle among us," returned the girl, stolidly. "We all
work for our living in this cotton-mill, but if we <i>are</i>
poor we are <i>honest</i>. Is that plain enough for you to
understand? If not, I will add this"&mdash;and stepping
up to the trembling girl's side, she whispered a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
sharp words in her ear&mdash;words that made Ida May
recoil as though they had been thrusts of a knife that
cut to her heart.</p>

<p>With a piteous cry she sunk on her knees, covering
her death-white face with her trembling hands.</p>

<p>"It remains with you to deny or affirm our accusation,"
went on the girl, harshly "What have you to
say to our charge, Ida May; is it true or false?"</p>

<p>There was no answer, save the heartrending sobs of
the girl cowering before them in such abject misery&mdash;surely
the most pitiful a human heart ever knew.</p>

<p>"You see she <i>can not</i> deny it," cried the ringleader,
turning triumphantly to her companions. "I assured
you all that I was certain before I advised this step.
We may well look upon her with scorn; she is not
worthy to breathe the same air with us!"</p>

<p>Ida May rose slowly to her feet.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>


<p>Half fainting with grief and pain, Ida May rushed
out into the street.</p>

<p>The sun was shining bright and warm, but it seemed
to the girl that the whole earth was dark and gloomy.</p>

<p>Where should she go? Which way should she turn?
She would not go back to the little lodging-house for
her few belongings; she never wanted to see it again.
Let them do what they would with her few belongings.
The few dollars that were hers, she happened to have in
the pocket of her dress.</p>

<p>"Royal!" she murmured, "I can not go to you in
this hour of my deepest woe!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>She drew her veil down over her face, and the
passers-by did not see the tears that rolled like rain
down her white, despairing face. It mattered little
to her which way she went.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard the sound of a voice just ahead
of her&mdash;a voice that sent a thrill to her heart.</p>

<p>"Heaven pity me!" she gasped; "it is Royal Ainsley!"</p>

<p>He was bidding good-bye to a companion on the
corner.</p>

<p>The next moment he had boarded a street car. With
a smothered cry, Ida May sprung after him. She must
see him, she must speak to him!</p>

<p>The car was crowded. He was in the front of the
car and she was at the rear. There was no way of
speaking to him. She must ride in the car as far as he
did, and when he alighted she must follow him. As
she watched him with strained eyes, she saw him greet
a young and lovely girl.</p>

<p>The sight made the blood turn cold in her veins:
Light, airy, gay as of yore he was, all unconscious of
the misery he had brought to a human heart. He had
wrecked her life. How could he stand there smiling
into the face of another girl?</p>

<p>Ida's heart swelled with bitter anguish.</p>

<p>She saw the young girl alight from the car at the
corner of a fashionable street, and Royal Ainsley accompanied
her. He took her arm and bent lovingly
over her. She was some rich man's daughter. Ida May,
who followed in their footsteps, was sure of that.</p>

<p>They entered a handsome brown-stone house midway
up the street. The veiled, dark-robed little figure
passed on, and stood at the end of the street until he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
should reappear. Scores of pedestrians passed as the
hours rolled on.</p>

<p>Up and down past the house she paced under cover of
the darkness. As she paced slowly to the other end of
the street, a coach stopped before the house she was so
intently watching.</p>

<p>Before she could reach a place where she could get
a full view, Royal Ainsley, with one or two others&mdash;she
could not tell whether they were men or women&mdash;ran
lightly down the steps and entered the vehicle,
which rolled rapidly away.</p>

<p>"I have missed him!" sobbed Ida May. "God help
me!"</p>

<p>On the morrow, Ida May was so ill that she could
not leave the little room to which she had come for
temporary shelter.</p>

<p>The woman who kept the place took a great interest
in her.</p>

<p>But every night, as soon as dusk had fallen, Ida
May took up her lonely vigil before the house Royal
Ainsley had visited.</p>

<p>In her anxiety she did not notice that she had been
observed from an upper window by the mistress of the
mansion. One night she found herself suddenly confronted
by that lady.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" she asked, grasping her
by the shoulder. "Speak at once!"</p>

<p>For a moment Ida May was so taken aback that she
could not utter a sound.</p>

<p>"Answer me at once, or I will have you arrested!"
repeated the lady.</p>

<p>Ida May hung down her head.</p>

<p>"I must and will know!" cried the lady, pitilessly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
"Are you watching for the butler or any of the servants?"</p>

<p>The young girl lifted her head as proudly as any
young queen might have done. She remembered those
weeks at Newport, during which she had been considered
the equal of the wealthiest girl there.</p>

<p>"No, madame!" she answered, sharply, "I was not
waiting for any of your servants to appear, but for one
of your guests."</p>

<p>The lady gave a little gasp; but in an instant she recovered
herself.</p>

<p>"A guest!" she repeated. "Of whom are you
speaking?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Royal Ainsley," replied Ida May, gasping the
words out brokenly, the tears falling like rain down her
face.</p>

<p>"Come inside," said the lady, drawing her hurriedly
into the hall-way, lest she should create a scene.
"Now," she said, standing before the girl with folded
arms, "let me hear all about the matter. You must
speak the truth, or I will certainly force it from you."</p>

<p>"It would illy become me to speak anything but the
truth," responded Ida May. "Royal Ainsley comes
here to see some beautiful young girl who lives in this
house. But this must not be. He is mine&mdash;mine&mdash;by
every tie that binds man to woman!"</p>

<p>"Surely he is not your&mdash;your&mdash;husband?" exclaimed
the lady, excitedly.</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he should have been," sobbed Ida May, in a
quivering voice. "It was all a mistake, a terrible mistake,"
she continued, wringing her hands.</p>

<p>The lady, who did not know her story, mistook her.</p>

<p>When she told her she started back in wonder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Quick as thought she had decided upon her course of
action.</p>

<p>"I wish to make an appointment with you," she
said, "to talk over this matter. Can you come here to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"No," said Ida May. "I shall be too busy. I have
some work from one of the stores, that will keep me
engaged."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can assist you so that it will not be
necessary for you to work so hard. Still, if to-morrow
is inconvenient, come in the evening."</p>

<p>She was about to add, "I pity you;" but there was
something in the girl's face that forbid her pity.</p>

<p>The lady watched her curiously until she was out of
sight. Then, with a sigh of relief, she walked slowly
up the grand staircase to her <i>boudoir</i>.</p>

<p>A young and lovely girl was reclining on a couch,
turning over the leaves of a photograph album.</p>

<p>"Well, did you find out what is the matter with the
girl?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the elder woman. "And you would
never guess what it was."</p>

<p>"Pardon me; but I shall not even try," said the
young girl, indolently, "for the simple reason that it
would be too much of an effort for me."</p>

<p>"I will tell you," said the lady, drawing up a chair;
"and I want you to pay the strictest attention, Florence
St. John."</p>

<p>"The subject will not interest me, mamma," returned
the young girl, turning over the leaves.</p>

<p>"But it <i>will</i> interest you," returned the other, "when
I tell you that it concerns your new handsome lover."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>She was quite right. The album fell to the floor
with a crash.</p>

<p>"It appears," said Mrs. St. John, "that young Ainsley
has got into some kind of an intrigue with a poor
but very pretty shop-girl. I think she must be a shop-girl."</p>

<p>"I shall write to him at once never to cross this
threshold again!" cried the young girl, indignantly.</p>

<p>"You will do nothing of the kind," replied her
mother. "Sit down and listen to me. All young men
are wild, and you must not take a man to task for
what he has done before he knew you. Shut your eyes
to it, and never bring it up to him. That's always
safest. If he thinks you <i>do</i> know about his past life,
he will be reckless, and think he doesn't need to care."</p>

<p>"About this girl, mamma&mdash;who is she?" she asked.</p>

<p>"A very pretty young creature," was the reply.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>


<p>Faint and heart-sick, Ida May crept down the broad
stone steps of the elegant mansion, and wended her way
back to her humble lodgings. Just as she was about to
touch the bell, a man ran hastily up the steps.</p>

<p>"Well, well, I declare!" he exclaimed, "I am at the
wrong house. But in this confounded tenement row,
one house is so like the other that one can not help
making a mistake now and then."</p>

<p>With a gasp, Ida May reeled backward. At the very
first word he had uttered, Ida May had recognized
Royal Ainsley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Frank Garrick, the manager of the telegraph
office.</p>

<p>The sentence had scarcely left his lips ere he recognized
her.</p>

<p>"Aha!" he cried, a fierce imprecation accompanying
the words. "So it's <i>you</i>, Ida May?" he added, catching
her fiercely by the cloak. "So I have found you at
last!"</p>

<p>She was too frightened to reply.</p>

<p>"So this is where you are stopping, is it? Come, walk
as far as the end of the street with me. I want to talk
to you."</p>

<p>"No!" cried Ida May, struggling to free herself from
his grasp. "I have nothing to say to you, nor will I
listen to you!"</p>

<p>"We shall see about that presently," he cried.
"Frank Garrick is not a man to be balked in this way
by a little girl. You <i>shall</i> listen to me!"</p>

<p>Ida May reached out her hand quickly to touch the
bell, but he anticipated the movement, and caught her
arm roughly.</p>

<p>She tried to cry out, but no sound issued from her
lips.</p>

<p>She had already gone through more than her overstrained
nerves could bear. Without a cry or a moan,
she sunk in a dead faint at his feet.</p>

<p>Gathering her up in his arms, Frank Garrick sprung
quickly down the steps. For a moment he stood there
with his helpless burden in his arms.</p>

<p>"This is quite an unexpected go," he muttered,
standing there undecided for a moment. "I must leave
her here a moment, that is certain, while I run for a
man's voice."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>He placed Ida on the the lower step, in a sitting position,
and darted down the street in the direction of
a cab-stand.</p>

<p>He did not see the open window of an adjoining
house, because of the closed blind which protected it,
nor the crouching form of the woman behind it, who
had heard and witnessed all.</p>

<p>Like a flash she caught up her hat, which was lying
on an adjacent table, and sprung out of the door.</p>

<p>"I knew he would come to see her at last!" she said,
fairly hissing the words. "They have had a quarrel.
That is why he has stayed away so long. He has gone
after a cab to take her elsewhere. But I will block his
little game!" cried Nannie Rogers&mdash;for it was she. "I
shall take a terrible revenge upon him by striking him
through her."</p>

<p>Taking a short cut to a nearer cab-stand, she hailed
the first vehicle. The man sprung down from his box.</p>

<p>"Why, is that you, Nannie?" he cried, in unfeigned
surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, Joe," she answered, quickly. "I want your
cab for a while."</p>

<p>In a few words she told him of a woman lying on
the steps of the house next to her&mdash;a woman whom she
wished to befriend.</p>

<p>"I want you to take her to a certain place. I will
tell you about it when we start. Come quickly and help
me to get her into your cab."</p>

<p>This was accomplished in less time than it takes to
tell it.</p>

<p>"Where to, Nannie?" asked the driver, as he picked
up the reins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why in the world are you taking her there?" he
exclaimed in dismay.</p>

<p>"Make no comments," she replied, angrily: "but
drive on as fast as you can. I wouldn't take her there
unless it was all right."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course," returned the driver. "I am not
saying but that you know what you're doing. But she
seems mighty quiet for that kind of a person."</p>

<p>They had scarcely turned the first corner ere Frank
Garrick drove up in a cab.</p>

<p>"By thunder! she has vanished!" he exclaimed, excitedly,
looking in astonishment at the spot where he
had left her a short time before. "She must have fled
into the house," he muttered. "Well, cabby, here's
your fee, anyhow. You may as well go back."</p>

<p>For some moments Frank Garrick stood quite still
and looked up at the house.</p>

<p>"Of all places in the world, who would have expected
to find her here&mdash;next door to Nannie. It's
certain that Nannie does not know of it. She could
not keep it if she did. Well, this is a pretty howdy-do&mdash;two
rivals living next door to each other. Nannie
is expecting me to call on her this evening. If it were
not for that, I wouldn't show up at all, I'm so upset by
that little beauty, Ida May."</p>

<p>Very slowly he walked up the steps of the adjoining
house and pulled the bell. To his great surprise, he
learned that Nannie was out.</p>

<p>"She will be sure to be back presently," added the
girl who answered the bell. "Won't you come in and
wait?"</p>

<p>"No," he answered, glad of the excuse. "I'll run in
some evening during the week."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>With that he turned on his heel and walked rapidly
away.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the carriage bearing Nannie Rogers and
the still unconscious Ida May rolled quickly onward,
and stopped at length before a red-brick building on the
outskirts of the city.</p>

<p>Ida May's swoon lasted so long that even Nannie
grew frightened.</p>

<p>"Wait," she said to the driver, "I will have to step
in first and see if they will receive her."</p>

<p>After fully five minutes had elapsed, the door opened
and a tall man looked out.</p>

<p>"It is I, doctor," said Nannie Rogers. "May I step
inside? I want to speak to you. I have a patient waiting
outside the gate."</p>

<p>"Dear me! is it really you? You come at rather a
late hour. Still, you know you are a priviliged person
here."</p>

<p>"I ought to be, since I have learned so many secrets
about the place and yourself," she said, "when I was
nurse here."</p>

<p>"Didn't I give you five hundred dollars to insure
secrecy when you left here?"</p>

<p>"Well, I kept my promise. I never told anything,
did I?"</p>

<p>"Let me understand what you want," he said,
abruptly. "Did I understand you to say that there
was a patient outside?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded.</p>

<p>"It does not matter who or what she is," she said,
tersely. "It is the desire of her friends that she be kept
here for a few months. I suppose you are anxious to
know about the pay?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course. That's where my interest comes in,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Well, I will be responsible for it," she said.</p>

<p>"You?" he said, amazedly.</p>

<p>"Yes; why not?" she returned.</p>

<p>He looked at her with something like doubt.</p>

<p>"You dare not refuse to accept her!" she declared.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that for a threat?" he exclaimed,
fiercely.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"I can not be held accountable for the way in which
you take my assertion," she declared.</p>

<p>The frown deepened on the man's face.</p>

<p>"For convenience's sake, we will say that the girl
is an opium-eater, and that is why you are keeping
her under such strict surveillance."</p>

<p>The man muttered some strange, unintelligible
remark.</p>

<p>"I suppose the cabman will help me in with the
girl?" he said, harshly.</p>

<p>"Of course," replied Nannie Rogers, impatiently.</p>

<p>The girl's figure was so light that "the doctor," as
he termed himself, found little difficulty in bringing
her into the house without aid.</p>

<p>Nannie Rogers stood in the hall-way, and followed
him into the reception room, where he laid the girl
down upon a rude couch. She watched him as he
threw back her long dark veil, and cried out in wonder
at the marvelous beauty of the still white face&mdash;the
face so like chiseled marble.</p>

<p>"How young and how very lovely!" he remarked;
and as he spoke, he unfolded the long dark cloak that
enveloped her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>A sharp exclamation broke from his lips, and he
turned around suddenly.</p>

<p>"Nannie Rogers!" he said.</p>

<p>But the look of astonishment that he saw on her
face was as great as his own bore. Nannie Rogers'
look of astonishment quickly gave way to one of the
most intense hatred; ay, a very demon of rage seemed
to have taken possession of her.</p>

<p>"I wonder that you brought her here," said the
doctor.</p>

<p>But Nannie Rogers was speechless. She was gazing
like one turned to stone upon the face of the girl whom
she believed to be her rival.</p>

<p>"I have a double reason for hating her now," she
said, under her breath, clinching her hands so tightly
that her nails cut deep into her palms. But she did
not even feel the pain.</p>

<p>"I say, I wonder that you brought her here," repeated
the doctor.</p>

<p>"I knew of no better place," she replied, turning her
eyes uneasily away from him. "You must not refuse
to receive her."</p>

<p>"Who is she?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I refuse to answer your question," she replied,
grimly. "You know only this about her: She is a
confirmed opium-eater. One who is very much interested
in her brought her here to be treated by you.
She is to be kept here, under strict watch, to prevent
her getting away. If she writes any letters they are
to be forwarded to me."</p>

<p>And thus it happened that when Ida May opened
her troubled eyes, after the doctor and an attendant
had worked over her for upward of an hour, she found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
herself in a strange room, with strange faces bending
over her. She looked blankly up at them.</p>

<p>"The waves are very high," she moaned. "Come
back on the beach, girls," she murmured.</p>

<p>"She is out of her head," exclaimed the doctor, turning
nervously to his attendant. "I ought not to have
taken this girl in," he continued, in alarm. "I fear
we shall have no end of trouble with her. This looks
like a long and lingering illness."</p>

<p>"She is so young, and as fair as a flower," murmured
the attendant, bending over her. "I feel very sorry
for her. If a fever should happen to set in, do you
think it would prove fatal to her?" she asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>"In nine cases out of ten&mdash;yes," he replied, brusquely.</p>

<p>At the very hour that this conversation was taking
place, Royal Ainsley, the scape-grace, was ascending
the brown-stone steps of the St. John mansion.</p>

<p>"I will take beautiful Florence and her stately
mamma to the ball to-night," he mused, under his
breath. "Before we return, I will have proposed to
the haughty beauty. Trust me for that. They think I
am the heir of my uncle, wealthy old Royal Ainsley, who
died recently, and&mdash;curse him!&mdash;left all his wealth to
my gentlemanly cousin, even making him change his
name to that of Eugene Mallard, that the outside world
might not confound it with mine. Yes, I will marry
beautiful Florence St. John, and live a life of luxury!"</p>

<p>In that moment there rose before his mental vision
the sweet sad face of beautiful Ida May, the fair
young girl whom he had wronged so cruelly and then
deserted so heartlessly.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>


<p>The servant who answered the bell at that moment,
put a stop to Royal Ainsley's musings.</p>

<p>He had only a few moments to wait in the drawing-room
before Miss St. John appeared.</p>

<p>She looked so lovely in her beautiful ball-dress that
his eyes glowed and his heart beat. Before he had an
opportunity to utter the words that were on his lips,
the young girl's mother entered the drawing-room.</p>

<p>She was so gay and bright with him, that the
mother wondered vaguely if she had forgotten the
story which she had told concerning him.</p>

<p>The warning glance which she gave her daughter
reminded her that she must act decorously.</p>

<p>The girl was very much in love, and it was easy
enough for her to forgive him for having had another
sweetheart.</p>

<p>He accompanied mother and daughter to the grand
ball. He was so gay and so brilliant and so witty,
that he charmed the beautiful Miss St. John more than
ever, and he knew by her smiles that his efforts were
not in vain.</p>

<p>Ainsley was the very poetry of motion. It was a
dream of delight to Florence St. John, as they made
the round of the magnificent ball-room, with his arms
clasped about her, his handsome face so near her own.</p>

<p>"Come into the conservatory, Florence," he whispered;
"I have something to tell you."</p>

<p>How strange it was the scene and the occasion did
not cause him to remember that <i>other</i> scene and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
<i>other</i> girl whom he had once brought into the conservatory
to listen to words of burning love!</p>

<p>"Florence," he whispered, "I have something to tell
you. Will you listen to me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, her heart beating furiously, for,
woman-like, she knew what was coming. The lovely
color on her cheeks deepened, the girl's blue eyes grew
luminous and tender.</p>

<p>"Florence," he cried, "how shall I tell you what
I have to say? Oh, Florence, let me tell it quickly,
lest my courage fail! I love you, dear&mdash;love you as
I have never loved any one in my life before!"</p>

<p>Looking into the dark, handsome face of the young
man before her, Florence St. John saw that she was
in the presence of a mighty passion&mdash;a great love.</p>

<p>In an instant he was kneeling by her side, his whole
soul in his eyes and on his lips. It was the very first
time in his life that Royal Ainsley's heart was ever
stirred with love.</p>

<p>If Florence St. John had even been poor, he would
have cared for her. He started in first by wanting the
girl for her money; it ended by his wanting her for
herself.</p>

<p>He caught the little hand in his that was carrying
the beautiful bouquet of roses he had sent her, and
held it tightly.</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven!" he said, "the time has come at
last, my beautiful love, for which I have waited so
long. Surely you know what I have to tell you, Florence!"
he said, drawing back and looking at her.</p>

<p>"I haven't the least idea," declared the girl, in
whom the spirit of coquetry was strong. "Really, I
do not understand."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"There needs be no understanding, my beautiful
love!" he cried. "None! I have come to tell you in
words what I have already told you a hundred times
in a hundred different ways&mdash;I love you with all my
heart! I love you! I know no other words. There is none
which can tell how dearly or how much all my heart,
my soul, my life goes out in those few words&mdash;I love
you!"</p>

<p>His voice died away in a whisper.</p>

<p>"I have a true and serious friendship for you, Mr.
Ainsley," she answered, coyly; "but I&mdash;I have never
thought of such a thing as love or marriage."</p>

<p>"Will you think of it <i>now</i>?" he answered, eagerly.</p>

<p>He loved her all the more for this sweet, womanly,
modest hesitation.</p>

<p>She arose from the seat near the fountain where he
had placed her.</p>

<p>"Well, let it rest in that way," she answered. "I'll
refer the subject to mamma; but you are not to say
one word of love to me, nor speak to her about the
matter for at least two months."</p>

<p>"Florence, you are cruel," he cried, "to keep me so
long in suspense. Tell me, at least, that if your mother
favors my suit, I may hope that you are not indifferent
to me."</p>

<p>But she would not answer him. Her heart beat high,
the fever of love throbbed in her veins; but, like all
well-bred young girls, she had been schooled by early
training to make no sign of preference for any man at
his first avowal of affection. As he led her from the
conservatory, past the fountain, the fragrant water-lilies,
past the green palms and the flowering orchids,
he gave a terrible start.</p>

<p>In that moment there came to him the memory of Ida
May. He was annoyed by the very thought of her in
that hour, and he quickly put it from him.</p>

<p>When they returned to the ball-room, Florence was
as sweet as ever; but neither by word or by sign
did she betray any rememberance of the scene which
had just occurred in the conservatory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>He left Florence and her mother at the door of their
home an hour later, but he did not have the opportunity
of holding the little white hand in his for one
moment, or of holding even a word of conversation
with her.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. St. John, when she and her daughter
found themselves alone for a moment, "I saw him
take you to the conservatory. You were gone a long
time. Did he propose?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" returned the girl, languidly.</p>

<p>"Yes!" echoed Mrs. St. John. "Why, how can
you take it so calmly, my Florence? You accepted
him, of course?"</p>

<p>"No," returned the girl, calmly. "I said that I
would like to have two months to consider the matter
before the subject was broached to you."</p>

<p>"You are mad, Florence!" cried her mother. "A
wealthy young man like that is not captured every
day."</p>

<p>"We are not so poor, mamma, that I should make
a god of wealth," said the girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly not," said her mother; "but I have
always been afraid you would be sought after by some
fortune-hunter."</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>


<p>"I am sorry," said Mrs. St. John, after a moment's
pause, "that you have refused to consider his suit for
at least two months. Eligible young men are not so
plentiful nowadays that a young girl can be so independent."</p>

<p>"I need not ask <i>you</i> what your opinion of an eligible
young man is," said the young girl, throwing back her
head haughtily, "for I know you would answer&mdash;a
large bank account. But in <i>my</i> opinion that does not
constitute all, where the happiness of a life-time is at
stake. I would rather marry a man whose reputation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
was spotless, if he did not have a second coat to his
back. There is something more than money in this
world to make our happiness. I am <i>glad</i> instead of
sorry that I refused to give him an answer for two
months. I shall demand to know who the young girl is
who came to our door, and what she is to him."</p>

<p>"Then you will be doing a very unwise thing," declared
her mother, emphatically. "Let well enough
alone. I told the girl to call around to-morrow night,
and when she comes I will have a talk with her."</p>

<p>"Will you permit me to be present at the interview,
mamma?"</p>

<p>"By no means!" exclaimed Mrs. St. John, with asperity.
"The story that no doubt will be unfolded to
me is not for ears such as yours. I will tell as much to
you as I deem necessary for you to know; let that
suffice."</p>

<p>But the young beauty and heiress was not to be appeased.
She made up her mind to see the girl at all
hazards when she should come; but much to the surprise
of both mother and daughter, the girl did not put
in an appearance.</p>

<p>That day passed, as did also the next and the next.
A week went by and lengthened into a fortnight, and
still the girl came not.</p>

<p>"You see, my dear, her statement was false!" cried
Mrs. St. John, triumphantly. "She feared that we
would investigate her story, and she was no doubt a
fraud. If you believe all those strange stories you
hear, you will have enough to do. She was no doubt
looking for hush-money, and when I did not offer to
give it to her, you see she did not return."</p>

<p>This seemed quite the truth, as Florence saw it.</p>

<p>How wrong it had been to even suspect him! She
made up her mind that if he should broach the subject
before the time she had named, she might not refuse
his pleading.</p>

<p>She was expecting him that very evening. He came
at last, looking so handsome, so buoyant, that the girl's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
heart went out to him at once, as the hearts of so many
women had done.</p>

<p>He brought her some beautiful violets, and he knew
he had as good as won her when he saw her fasten them
in the bodice of her dress.</p>

<p>Florence St. John was sitting in a velvet arm-chair
but a short distance away. Her beautiful face was
softened, more so than he had ever seen it before, the
smile on her lips was sweeter&mdash;the proud, half-defiant,
flashing loveliness seemed all at once to grow gentle.</p>

<p>He no longer seemed quite sure of her. It was Florence
St. John's silence that alarmed him, perhaps.</p>

<p>"I wish," he cried, "that I knew in what words and
in what fashion other men make love."</p>

<p>"Does not your own heart teach you?" asked the
young girl, suddenly.</p>

<p>His face flushed at the question.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered; "but I am not sure that the
teachings are of the right kind. You have not answered
me, and it must be <i>my</i> fault, either because I have not
expressed myself properly or that I have not made myself
understood. Florence, I want you&mdash;with my whole
heart I ask you&mdash;I want you to become my wife."</p>

<p>"Am I the first person you have ever told this to?"
she asked, slowly, looking him in the face.</p>

<p>Almost every girl he had ever made love to had
asked him the same question, and he was not abashed
by it.</p>

<p>The ever-ready answer was on his lips instantly.</p>

<p>"How could you ever believe that I had spoken one
word of love to any one but yourself," he said, reproachfully.
"No other face has ever had the slightest
attraction for me. The men of my race have but one
love in a life-time. I have never loved before I met
you. I shall love you until I die. Are you answered?"</p>

<p>He looked straight into her face as he uttered the
falsehood.</p>

<p>There did sweep across his mind, as he uttered the
falsehood, the memory of Ida May; but he put it from
him quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>How strange it was that her memory should always
haunt him, try hard as he would to banish it!</p>

<p>"You are quite sure that you never loved any girl
but me?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"<i>Quite</i> sure," he responded. "To doubt me causes
me great pain, Florence."</p>

<p>"Then forget that I asked the question," she said,
sweetly, believing in him implicitly.</p>

<p>"And you will be mine?" he whispered, holding the
little hand closer.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, solemnly.</p>

<p>He caught her in his arms in a transport of delight.</p>

<p>"Thank you&mdash;thank you for those words, Ida!" he
cried.</p>

<p>"Did I understand you to call me <i>Ida</i>?" she asked in
wonder.</p>

<p>"No," he answered, boldly, cursing himself for the
slip of the tongue. "I was about to add: 'I do so
thank you,' but you did not give me an opportunity to
finish the sentence."</p>

<p>The falsehood was so adroitly told that she believed
him.</p>

<p>"I shall have to put a curb on my tongue, or Heaven
knows what name I shall be saying next."</p>

<p>Should she tell him of the young girl who was at the
door waiting to see him? She remembered her mother's
words the next moment, to say nothing of the matter.</p>

<p>"Now that you have been so good as to consent to
marry me, we are to consider ourselves engaged. The
question is, when will you marry me? It may as well
be <i>soon</i> as late."</p>

<p>"Oh, I really don't know about that now," she declared.</p>

<p>"Make me happy by saying that it will be as soon as
possible," he urged.</p>

<p>There was no denying anything he asked in that winsome
voice.</p>

<p>"I promise," she repeated, after another pause.</p>

<p>He caught her in his arms and strained her to his
bosom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have made me the happiest man in the whole
wide world, Florence!" he cried, rapturously.</p>

<p>Suddenly his arms fell from her and he reeled backward,
staring at the window with widely dilated eyes.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Royal? Are you ill?" cried
Florence, in the greatest terror.</p>

<p>"Some one passed along the porch just outside the
window," he panted&mdash;"a woman hurrying toward the
vestibule door. She will ring the bell in a moment!"
he gasped.</p>

<p>At that instant there was a heavy peal at the front
door bell.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>


<p>"Florence," repeated Royal Ainsley, his face white
as death, his teeth chattering, "order the servants not
to answer the bell!"</p>

<p>But it was too late; the door had already swung back
on its hinges. An instant later the servant appeared
with a card.</p>

<p>"A gentleman, miss," he said. "I told him you were
not at home, as you requested."</p>

<p>Florence St. John held the card in her white fingers.</p>

<p>"You see, it was not a lady," she said, half amused
at his agitation.</p>

<p>He drew a breath of intense relief.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Florence," he said. "I&mdash;I&mdash;thought it
was one of your girl friends who was about to share
your attention with me. I gave way to my annoyance.
Be kind, and forget it. Remember the old adage: 'One
finds much to pardon in a man who is in love.'"</p>

<p>His explanation of the matter satisfied her. Very
young girls are never suspicious. The remembrance
of that one evening always stood out bright and clear
in Florence St. John's life. She gave herself up to
happiness, and when Royal urged her to name an early
day, she laughingly consented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"All the ladies in our family have been married in
April," she declared.</p>

<p>"That is almost four months from now, my darling,"
he groaned. "Do not ask me to wait so long. So much
might take place within that time!"</p>

<p>He was about to add "to part us," but stopped himself
just in time.</p>

<p>"A lady has to have a <i>trousseau</i> prepared," she said,
archly. "And when you put yourself in the hands of
these <i>modistes</i>, you are at their mercy; they will not
be hurried. Mamma, I am sure, would not consent to
an earlier marriage than that. I hope that I may persuade
her to do so."</p>

<p>"You will allow me to persuade her differently, if
I can?" he asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes, if you can," she answered.</p>

<p>"I will try to settle it before I leave the house this
very night," he declared. "Ah, here comes your
mother now! If you will make some kind of an excuse
to absent yourself from the room, my darling, for a
few moments, I will urge my suit so eloquently that
she will find it difficult to say 'no' to me."</p>

<p>Mrs. St. John greeted the young man pleasantly as
she entered. She was too thoroughly a woman of the
world to greet him effusively, knowing, had she done
so, it would be sure to make him too confident of success.</p>

<p>Royal Ainsley laid himself out to please the mother
as he had never attempted to please an elderly woman
before.</p>

<p>"You asked me to play over a new piece of music
for you when you came. If you will please excuse me
for a moment, I will get it," said Florence, glancing
up shyly at him with laughing eyes, as much as to say,
"I am going to give you a chance for the longed-for interview
with mamma"&mdash;a look which Royal Ainsley
answered with a nod. Florence had scarcely reached
the upper landing ere Royal Ainsley left his seat, and
walked eagerly over to Mrs. St. John's side.</p>

<p>"My dear lady," he began, dropping into a seat opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
her, "I want to tell you a little story and hear
your opinion about it."</p>

<p>Mrs. St. John was wise enough to know what was
coming, but she did not betray more than the usual
interest.</p>

<p>"It is the story of a young man who wished to possess
a treasure which belonged to another. He yearned
for it with all his soul.</p>

<p>"My dear lady, not to beat further round the bush, let
me say I am the young man who wishes to possess the
treasure which you hold as sacred. That treasure is
your beautiful daughter Florence, my dear lady. I
love her with all my heart. I want your consent to
make her my wife."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear me!" exclaimed Mrs. St. John, apparently
greatly frustrated. "I hope you have not spoken
a word of this to the dear child."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have, and we have both determined to abide
by your decision, as to how long we shall have to wait,
though we both hope you will set as early a day as
possible."</p>

<p>"Remember that my Florence is only a school-girl
yet," declared the mother. "I could not think of parting
from her yet."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear lady!" cried Royal Ainsley, "do not
doom me to such pitiful suspense, I beg of you! There
are some men who could wait with much patience, but
I am not one of them. I should have to go away and
travel incessantly."</p>

<p>This was exactly what Mrs. St. John did not wish to
happen. The gilded youth before her was too good a
catch in the matrimonial market to lose.</p>

<p>Every mother is always glad to have her daughter
make a good match. She was no exception to the rule.</p>

<p>And when she read in the paper, a few months later,
of that uncle's death, and that he had left his vast
wealth to his nephew, Royal Ainsley, she was determined
that no effort should be spared to make him fall
in love with her daughter.</p>

<p>He grew eloquent in his pleading. Ere ten minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
more had elapsed, he had drawn from Mrs. St. John's
lips the promise that the wedding should take place in
four months' time at the very latest.</p>

<p>He made up his mind to accept this decision for the
present, but he would certainly depend upon his own
eloquence and persuasive powers in the near future to
overcome her scruples and influence her to name an
earlier day.</p>

<p>He left the house that night buoyant of spirits and
gay of heart. It was strange that in that hour he
thought of Ida May.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>


<p>We must now return to Ida May, dear reader, and
the thrilling experiences the poor girl was passing
through in the lonely stone house on the river-road.</p>

<p>Owing to the drug which was being constantly administered
to her, from the hour she crossed the threshold
Ida knew little or nothing of what was going on
in the outside world.</p>

<p>The days lengthened into weeks, and the weeks into
months.</p>

<p>Her remittances came regularly; still, the "doctor"
of the sanitarium was heartily sick of his bargain. He
dared not refuse Nannie Rogers' request to keep her
there, for reasons which would put him behind the
prison bars had they reached the ears of the authorities.</p>

<p>When he saw the girl grow whiter and more fragile
with each passing day, his alarm increased.</p>

<p>In this horrible place Ida May wore out four long
and weary months of her young life.</p>

<p>They had long since ceased giving her the drug. It
was unnecessary now to waste any more of it upon her.</p>

<p>When Ida May's mind slowly cleared, and a realization
of what was going on about her came to her, she
looked in the greatest astonishment at the strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
apartment and the grim-faced woman who was bringing
food to her.</p>

<p>"Where am I, and who are you?" she asked. "Oh,
I remember! I swooned on the steps of the boarding-house.
Did <i>he</i> have me brought here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," retorted the doctor's sister, thinking that the
better way of stopping all questioning.</p>

<p>A bitter cry of horror rose to Ida May's lips.</p>

<p>"Then I must go away from here at once!" she declared,
attempting to gain her feet.</p>

<p>But she was so weak that she staggered and would
have fallen had not the woman sprung forward and
saved her.</p>

<p>"Don't go on in that way," said the woman,
brusquely. "You are to remain here until you are&mdash;well.
It won't be over a fortnight longer. You've
been here some time."</p>

<p>"But I <i>will not</i> remain here!" exclaimed Ida May,
excitedly. "I shall leave at once!"</p>

<p>The woman turned the key in the lock, coolly removed
it, and slipping it into her pocket, remarked:</p>

<p>"This is a sanitarium. It is not for patients to say
when they shall leave here. <i>That</i> is the doctor's business."</p>

<p>"But tell me, why does any one wish to keep me
here?" cried Ida May, piteously. "No one in the whole
world has any interest in me."</p>

<p>"I am surprised to hear you say that," declared the
woman, grimly, with something very much like a sneer
in her harsh voice.</p>

<p>The words, the tone in which they were uttered, and
the look which accompanied them, cut the poor girl
to the heart.</p>

<p>"Let me tell you about the man who brought me
here," cried Ida, trembling like a leaf, believing it
must certainly be her sworn enemy, Frank Garrick,
who had taken cruelly taken advantage of her to abduct
her when she swooned on the boarding-house
stoop.</p>

<p>"I have no time to listen to you," exclaimed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
woman. "We are strictly forbidden to talk to the
patients or listen to their tales of woe, which are
always woven out of whole cloth."</p>

<p>"You are a woman like myself," cried Ida May,
sobbing bitterly. "Surely you can not find it in your
heart to turn a deaf ear to me, for pity's sake, if for
nothing else."</p>

<p>But the woman was inexorable, and said:</p>

<p>"I tell you, I don't want to hear what you have got
to say&mdash;and I <i>won't</i>, that's all about it. If you make
any fuss, you will be put on a diet of bread and water."</p>

<p>"But answer me this one question," said Ida May,
in terror. "What reason has any one in keeping me
here against my will?"</p>

<p>The woman shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"There may be plenty of reasons," she retorted,
sharply. "Perhaps you are a wife that some man
wants to be rid of. Then, again, perhaps you are no
wife&mdash;a better reason still for some young man wishing
to get you safely out of his path just now. A father
or a brother may have brought you here to save the
family honor. I could go on with any amount of
practical reasons."</p>

<p>"Have I not told you that I am all alone in the
world?" panted the poor girl, clinging to her with
death-cold hands.</p>

<p>"Yes; but I have good reason to think otherwise,"
replied the woman, bluntly. "There's no use in your
making a fuss," continued the woman, harshly. "You
may have to put in a long time beneath this roof."</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>


<p>Long hours after the woman left the room, Ida May
sat by the window looking out into the darkness, and
trying to fathom what seemed to her the greatest kind
of a mystery.</p>

<p>Why should Frank Garrick take interest enough in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
her to have her brought here and to pay money for
having her retained here? What interest could he
have in her?</p>

<p>He had vowed a terrible vengeance upon her when
she repulsed his offer of love. But why should his
vengeance have taken this form? What benefit could
it be to him to shut her in from the world?</p>

<p>As Ida sat there in the waning light, her eyes fell
upon a piece of newspaper in the open fire-place.</p>

<p>"I will wrap up my few belongings in that," she
muttered, "and then set about making my way out of
this place."</p>

<p>As she smoothed out the half sheet, a few lines midway
down one of the columns held her spell-bound as
they caught her eye.</p>

<p>For a moment she stared at the words. They seemed
to fairly turn the heart in her bosom to stone, for they
read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">"The engagement is announced of Miss Florence St.
John, of No. &mdash;, Fifth Avenue, daughter of Mrs. J. St.
John, to Mr. Royal Ainsley, of New York. The wedding
will take place at Peekskill, on the Hudson, a
month from date."</p>
</blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">As she read it, the room seemed to whirl around her.
With a cry so piteous that it seemed it must reach
God's ear, the poor girl sunk on her knees.</p>

<p>Her husband about to marry another!</p>

<p>No matter what the world might say, she had married
him in good faith. He was hers; he belonged to her
before Heaven and all the world.</p>

<p>She wrung her hands wildly.</p>

<p>"The marriage must not take place! I must save
the man I love from himself and the anger of the
watching angels!" she cried.</p>

<p>She prayed wildly that she might not be too late.</p>

<p>Her hat and cloak were hanging on a peg near the
door. She took them down, and her hands trembled so
that she could hardly put them on. Her knees trembled,
and she felt faint. But she summoned all her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
strength, and reached the door and turned the knob.
But it was locked on the outside.</p>

<p>Her weak hands were powerless to force the door.
She crept back to the window and threw open the
sash. All that she could behold was a dense mass
of trees.</p>

<p>A sturdy oak grew close to the window, its great
branches spread out invitingly before her. It was a
desperate chance to take in order to reach the ground,
which was fully thirty feet below.</p>

<p>Would her strength give way? Dare she take the
terrible risk?</p>

<p>"I must! I must!" she cried. "Heaven will protect
me!"</p>

<p>Without stopping to debate the matter further, lest
she should lose courage, the poor girl climbed with
difficulty out on the broad sill and grasped one of the
boughs.</p>

<p>Would it bear her weight?</p>

<p>The great bough creaked with its unaccustomed
weight, slight as it was, then shot downward.</p>

<p>In the old days at home Ida May had been accustomed
to climb trees and to swing about in their
branches. She realized that when the bough bent its
entire length earthward she must let go her hold, or it
would carry her quickly up again. She let go her hold
when she felt that the bough of the tree had bent to
its utmost. Quickly she fell downward, and Ida May,
stunned and helpless for a moment, found herself lying
in the long green grass.</p>

<p>She had scarcely fallen three feet, yet the shock
had stunned her.</p>

<p>She knew that she must be on some country road.
Afar in the distance she could distinctly see rows of
glimmering lights. Those she knew must be the lights
of the city. She must reach it and find the house on
Fifth Avenue before she dared give herself a moment's
rest.</p>

<p>She reached the outskirts of the city at last, and
crept on toward its great throbbing heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Like one in a dream, Ida May saw a tall, thin woman
and a young girl, who appeared to be her maid, step
from a carriage.</p>

<p>She tried to get out of their way, but if her very life
had depended upon it, she could not have done so.
The tall woman and Ida May jostled against each other.</p>

<p>With a sharp exclamation of anger, the lady turned
upon her. But at that moment Ida reeled, and, with a
piteous moan, fell senseless at her feet.</p>

<p>"Well, well! here's a pretty howdy-do!" exclaimed
the tall, angular woman. "Here, John!" she
called to the footman, who was just shutting the door of
the vehicle, "pick up this poor creature, and carry her
into the house. It appears I have knocked her down. I
hope no bones are broken."</p>

<p>The house into which Ida May was carried was a
very small cottage, occupied by a poor laborer and his
wife, who were the parents of a little one who was ill
but was slowly convalescing.</p>

<p>The wealthy spinster and her maid often called to
bring some fruit or medicine to the child.</p>

<p>Miss Fernly was not fair to look upon, but she had
a heart of gold. She was quite eccentric; but her
purse was always open to the wants of the needy.</p>

<p>"Leave the room instantly," she said to her maid.
"Run out and tell the coachman to go for the nearest
doctor, and to fetch him back with him at once!"</p>

<p>It seemed an age until the doctor arrived. Everything
in human power was done to render the sufferer
comfortable.</p>

<p>It was early morn when the doctor departed&mdash;and
there had come into this great world of sorrow a dark-eyed
little stranger&mdash;a tiny little one, with a lovely
face like its mother's.</p>

<p>"Will it live?" cried the young mother, as she listened
breathlessly to its faint little wails.</p>

<p>"I am afraid not," replied the doctor pityingly.
"We can only hope."</p>

<p>"Oh, if it would only die&mdash;only die!" sobbed the
girl's mother. "The world is so cold and so dark!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Fernly drew back, shocked and pained.</p>

<p>"You must not wish for anything like that to happen,"
she said, "for God might take you at your word."</p>

<p>For ten long and weary days the hapless young
mother lay with her face to the wall, crying out to
Heaven to take her and her baby from this cruel world.</p>

<p>In great fear, the doctor had taken charge of the little
one, and conveyed it to a near-by foundling asylum. Its
presence seemed to irritate the hapless young mother,
who was already in a high fever.</p>

<p>Miss Fernly called every day at the cottage, to see
how her latest charge was progressing.</p>

<p>She had taken a strange interest in the girl whose
identity seemed shrouded in such profound mystery.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>


<p>The beautiful girl lying so ill under Miss Fernly's
care grew steadily worse. Her constant cry for the
little one was most pitiful to hear.</p>

<p>"How are we to let her know that it is slowly fading
away?" said the woman to the doctor.</p>

<p>"We will not let her know until the last moment;
it would do her no good, and be only a setback for
her," he responded.</p>

<p>Miss Fernly pitied the young mother from the very
depths of her heart. It made this spinster more than
ever enraged at men. She had tried to gain the girl's
confidence. But it had all been in vain. Ida would lie
for hours, looking out of the window at the fleecy
clouds, muttering piteously:</p>

<p>"It must have taken place by this time! Oh! I am
too late, too late!"</p>

<p>At last Miss Fernly's curiosity got the better of her.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me what you mean by those words,
my dear?" she asked, one day. "Perhaps I can help
you in some way."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," returned Ida May, wearily. "It would be
useless, useless."</p>

<p>Miss Fernly took the little white hand in her own
and pressed it gently.</p>

<p>"Do not say that, my dear, and in that tone; it is
not right. Heaven is always kind enough to send a
friend to those who are in need of help."</p>

<p>"You are right," said the girl, quickly. "In my life
I have been used to cruelty and unkindness. I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped for a moment, and something like a
flush crossed her pale cheeks; then she burst into tears.</p>

<p>"I will tell you my story, my good lady," she
sobbed; "for the weight of it is eating my soul away."</p>

<p>With her throbbing little hands still held tightly in
Miss Fernly's, she sobbed wretchedly:</p>

<p>"Surely it is the cruelest story that ever a young girl
had to tell. I might have led a happy life if I had not
been foolish enough to want to be a fine lady. I had
often read of such things happening, and oh! I believed
it. Cinderella was changed from a kitchen-maid
to a fairy princess, and oh! how happy she was, if but
for a brief hour.</p>

<p>"It seemed to me that an opportunity always came
for those who watched for it. One came to me. A
wealthy family took me with them to Newport for the
summer, and there I met a young man fair of face,
handsome as a dream. I had never before seen any one
like him. You will not wonder that my heart went
out to him. I had known him but a few short weeks
ere he asked me to marry him, counseling a secret marriage,
and I&mdash;I consented. It was not a regular minister
who married us, but a&mdash;a&mdash;mayor, or somebody like
that.</p>

<p>"My husband brought me to the city. We had barely
reached here, after an all-night's journey, when I
learned to my horror that he believed me to be the
heiress of the wealthy people with whom I had been
stopping. When I told him I was not, what a change
there came over him! With a face as white as it would
ever be in death, he drew back and looked at me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Not an heiress?' he cried. 'Great heavens! what
an eternal fool I have made of myself!'</p>

<p>"He left my presence quickly, telling me that it was
all a mistake&mdash;that the man who had married us had
not the power to do so; that it was just as well, perhaps,
for he never could wed a poor girl.</p>

<p>"He advised me to go home and forget him, adding
insult to injury by concluding with the cruel words;
'Such a little incident in the life of a working-girl will
not amount to anything.'"</p>

<p>"The scoundrel of a man!" cried Miss Fernly, in intense
indignation. "I wonder that a righteous God lets
such men live!"</p>

<p>She found herself intensely interested in the story of
this beautiful young girl, whose innocent face she could
not help but trust from the first moment that she beheld
it.</p>

<p>At first it had occurred to Miss Fernly to ask the
name of the rascal, her husband; then she told herself
that in all probability it was a false one, and that he
could not be traced by it.</p>

<p>"I will think the matter over," said Miss Fernly,
"and conclude what action you should take. For your
child's sake, you can not allow this man to go free. You
would be committing a crime against society at large."</p>

<p>Just at that moment the doctor entered the room.
He motioned Miss Fernly to one side. By some strange
intuition, Ida May guessed the import of his visit.</p>

<p>"My&mdash;my little one!" she cried, inquiringly&mdash;"tell
me of her! How is she?"</p>

<p>For a moment the doctor was silent.</p>

<p>"I may as well tell the truth now as tell it at some
future time," he thought, pityingly.</p>

<p>"Tell me what news do you bring of my little
child?" cried Ida.</p>

<p>He crossed over to where the hapless young girl
sat, and bent over her pityingly.</p>

<p>"The little one is dead!" he said in a low, hushed
voice.</p>

<p>It was dying when he left the foundling asylum. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
he gazed upon it, he said to himself that it would be
but a question of a few short hours. He turned away
from it, leaving it in the care of the good nurses, that
he might go and gently break the sad news to the
young mother.</p>

<p>While Miss Fernly and the hapless young mother
were discussing the flowers they would plant over
baby's grave, the nurses, with bated breath, were
standing around the little cot. Another physician
sat by the cot, holding the waxen wrist.</p>

<p>"Quick! hand me the cordial!" he cried. "I may
be able to save this little life!"</p>

<p>A small vial was hurriedly handed to him. He
poured a few drops between the white lips, and sat
down again, patiently awaiting the result.</p>

<p>"If the infant lives five minutes, it will be able to
pull through," he observed, quietly.</p>

<p>They watched the great clock on the opposite wall,
whose pendulum swung noiselessly to and fro. One
minute, two; there was no change. A third; the doctor
bent his ear to listen for the feeble breathing, holding
a mirror close to the child's lips. There was moisture
upon it as he drew it away. Another moment, the
crucial moment, was reached.</p>

<p>"See! it is dying!" whispered one of the nurses,
touching the doctor's arm.</p>

<p>A half minute more, and then another half minute
passed by.</p>

<p>"The baby will live!" exclaimed the doctor, rising
to his feet. "Yes, the baby will live," repeated the
doctor. "It has had a hard time of it, I see, but it
has conquered death.</p>

<p>"It is so strange," he mused, "whom nobody wants
or seems to care for clings to life most tenaciously, as
though it were worth having.</p>

<p>"A few hours since I was at the home of one of
the wealthiest families in the city. That young
mother's babe died, though I did everything in human
power to save it. The father caught me by the arm
when I was first called there, and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Doctor, save that little child upstairs, and it will
be the making of your fortune. You shall name your
own price. Stay right here, by night and by day, until
it is out of danger, and anything you may ask for shall
be yours.'</p>

<p>"He led me through the marble hall and past gilded
drawing-rooms and spacious parlors to the chamber
above where mother and child lay. It was a plump
little mite, with everything to live for. I thought my
task would be an easy one; but you have heard the old
saying: 'Man proposes, but God disposes.'</p>

<p>"Well it was so in this case. It had only the
measles&mdash;a disease which every little one has at some
time during infancy. No wonder I felt no alarm.</p>

<p>"Although I did my best, it began to fail. I summoned
all the experts in the city, bringing together
men who were older and wiser than myself, to discover
what could possibly be the reason why my skill had
failed me in this instance.</p>

<p>"There was nothing which science could suggest
that we did not do. But it seemed that fate was
against us. The child literally faded before our very
eyes, and passed away.</p>

<p>"This one had no such chance of life as the other
had, yet it has passed through an illness so dangerous
that not one in a thousand ever live through. I
predict that it will have an uncommon future," he
added, thoughtfully.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>


<p>For long hours after the doctor had left Ida May, she
wept so bitterly over the fate of her little child that
Miss Fernly grew alarmed.</p>

<p>"Crying will not bring the baby back," she said.
"The Almighty knew best whether He wanted it to
live or die. You must not rail against the judgment
of God!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>She felt that she must draw her mind into another
channel.</p>

<p>"Say that you will be more composed when I see
you again," she replied, earnestly, "though it may not
be for some days."</p>

<p>"I will try," murmured Ida May, with a sigh.
"Will it be long before I see you?" she added, wistfully.</p>

<p>"I am going to my niece's wedding," answered Miss
Fernly. "I may remain a few days after at the house."</p>

<p>Ida May drew a long, deep sob.</p>

<p>"How strange the word 'marriage' sounds to me
now," she moaned. "When I hear of a young girl's
marriage nowadays, I earnestly pray Heaven that her
husband may not deceive her!"</p>

<p>"I am sure that there need be nothing to fear in
<i>this</i> instance," said Miss Fernly. "My niece sent me
her <i>fianc's</i> picture this morning. He seems to be a
noble young fellow. By the way, I will show it to
you," she added, still believing that the one thing
needful was to divert the girl's mind.</p>

<p>Thoughtless as to what would accrue from her action,
Miss Fernly drew a small case from her pocket and
touched the spring.</p>

<p>The lid flew back, disclosing a magnificent affair in
ivory&mdash;the portrait of a young and handsome man.</p>

<p>"He has an honest look in his eyes, and a fair, open
countenance," said Miss Fernly. "It was painted
three years ago."</p>

<p>As she uttered the words, she handed the portrait to
Ida May.</p>

<p>One glance, then a cry of the wildest horror broke
from the girl's white, terrified lips.</p>

<p>"God have mercy!" she gasped, "it is he!"</p>

<p>Miss Fernly sprung to her feet, quite as white and
terrified as Ida.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you do not mean to say that this is the man
who wrought all your woe?" she cried, in horror too
great for words.</p>

<p>"Yes!" cried Ida May, springing to her feet, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
crying out: "I swear to you that this is Royal Ainsley,
the man whom I wedded, and who deserted me! This
is the father of my little dead babe!"</p>

<p>The expression upon Miss Fernly's face was horrible
to see.</p>

<p>She rose in awful wrath and struck her hands
sharply together as she turned and faced the girl.</p>

<p>"It was fate that sent you across my path," she exclaimed,
hoarsely. "But for this timely intervention
my innocent niece would have wedded that villain on
the morrow. But I thank Heaven that I am now able
to prevent it, and to avenge you as well, my poor
child. Ah!" she cried, as a sudden thought flashed
through her mind, "an idea has come to me, by which
I can not only wreak my vengeance upon him, but mete
out justice to you as well."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no; do not do anything to harm him!"
cried Ida May, in terror. "Cruel as he has been to me,
I love him still, and I shall always love him!"</p>

<p>"What I intend to do will not harm him. I repeat
that it will right your wrong," she added, grimly.
"There shall be a wedding to-morrow, my poor, unfortunate
girl. But listen to me well, and heed what I
say&mdash;<i>you</i> shall be this man's bride to-morrow, instead
of my niece. Leave everything to me."</p>

<p>She gathered up her wrap and gloves and put them
on.</p>

<p>"I shall have a great deal to do between now and
nightfall. But this I say to you, Ida May: Be ready
to go with me when I shall come for you. It may be
to-night, perhaps to-morrow night. Ask me no questions
now, but trust in me implicitly. Since the hour I came
across you in your misfortune, you have found me a
good friend to you, Ida May, have you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," sobbed Ida May, wretchedly. "I&mdash;I&mdash;would
have perished in the street but for you, noble lady.
I respect and have all confidence in you."</p>

<p>"Then by that confidence do as I bid you," repeated
Miss Fernly. "I will send some clothing for you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
wear. Wrap about you the long, dark cloak you wore
in coming here, and be in readiness."</p>

<p>With these words, Miss Fernly fairly flew from the
cottage.</p>

<p>Ida May sunk back in her chair, pale and excited.</p>

<p>"Why should the announcement that he is to be
married to-morrow have shocked me?" she moaned.
"I had every reason to expect that would occur any
day after I read it myself in the paper."</p>

<p>She did not sob or cry out. It seemed to Ida that
the very heart within her was crushed. She had borne
so much that it appeared there was nothing more left
for her to endure.</p>

<p>Miss Fernly was thankful beyond words that she
had not brought her maid with her on her last visit.</p>

<p>In all possible haste she hurried to the magnificent
home of her sister on Riverside Drive.</p>

<p>Although living in the same city, the married sister
saw very little of Miss Fernly, the latter devoted so
much of her time to charity. She had not been to the
house but once since Mrs. Cramer had written to her
of her daughter Hildegarde, and that she was soon to
be married.</p>

<p>Hildegarde was delighted when she looked out and
saw her aunt drive up.</p>

<p>"What a surprise, dear aunt!" she cried, throwing
her white arms about her. "Mamma and I were just
speaking of you. I was almost afraid that you had
forgotten the date set for the wedding. And just to
think you have never met my intended, and he so anxious
to see the darling aunt I have always been talking
of! I want you to see him, he is so lovely. But what
did you think of the picture?" rattled on Hildegarde,
in her gay, girlish fashion, without giving the other
a chance to answer.</p>

<p>"You are very, very much in love with him?" asked
Miss Fernly, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I be?" cried the girl, blushing as
red as a rose, and hiding her peachy face against her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
aunt's broad shoulder. "No girl ever had a more devoted
lover."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is plainly to be seen that you do love him,"
said Miss Fernly, sternly.</p>

<p>"I do not know what to tell you about him, auntie,
except that he is the dearest fellow in all the world,
and just adores me; at least, that is what he tells me,"
said Hildegarde.</p>

<p>"Humph!" ejaculated Miss Fernly.</p>

<p>"I would rather you would see him for yourself, then
you could form your own opinion. He will be here this
evening. I am sure you will like him."</p>

<p>"At what time do you expect him!" asked Miss
Fernly, with unusual interest.</p>

<p>"Let me answer you in the words of the song," said
Hildegarde, laughing lightly.</p>

<p>
"'Somebody's coming when the dew-drops fall.'"<br />
</p>

<p>"Do not be silly, Hildegarde," said her aunt, sharply.</p>

<p>"I asked you what time this young man is to call here
this evening."</p>

<p>"It is generally half past seven when he arrives,"
said Miss Cramer, smiling mischievously.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Miss Fernly. "When he calls, I
will go down into the parlor and interview him."</p>

<p>"I'm sure he would be most delighted," returned the
young girl, demurely.</p>

<p>"That's neither here nor there," returned Miss Fernly.
"I do not care whether he likes me or not."</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>


<p>Miss Fernly had made her resolution. She would
interview this man when he came. She would foil him,
this fiend in human form, who would wed one young
and lovely girl after bringing sorrow to another.</p>

<p>When Miss Fernly made up her mind to a course,
nothing could change it.</p>

<p>"What I am about to do is for Hildegarde's good,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
she told herself grimly. "There will be a few tears at
first, but the time will come when she will thank me
with all her heart for saving her from such a consummate
rascal. The woman of our race have never forgiven
men who have deceived other women. Hildegarde
should not be an exception to the rule. She is
young now, but when she comes to know more about
life she will thank me for saving her."</p>

<p>"Now," said her aunt, aloud, depositing herself in
the nearest chair, and deliberately removing her hat
and mantle, "tell me about this sweetheart of yours."</p>

<p>Hildegarde came over to the hassock and flung herself
down upon it and looked up with laughing eyes
into her aunt's face.</p>

<p>"I sent you his picture," she said, "because you did
not seem inclined to come here to meet him, auntie, so
that you could see for yourself just how he looks. But
it does not do him justice," went on Hildegarde, clasping
her hands. "That portrait does not tell you how
good and noble he is, and how much he thinks of me!"</p>

<p>An expression that was almost divine came over the
face of Hildegarde Cramer as she uttered the words
in a low, sweet voice.</p>

<p>"Tell me about him," again urged her aunt, anxious
to fathom just how deep was the love the girl bore
him.</p>

<p>Should she confide in Hildegarde the story of Ida
May, Miss Fernly knew that the present state of affairs
must end.</p>

<p>There were girls who would turn in horror from a
man who had done as cruel a deed as that which was
laid at the door of the man whom Hildegarde was about
to marry. But might not Hildegarde cling to him
despite all?</p>

<p>"He is all that is noble," continued Hildegarde,
dreamily.</p>

<p>"What if he should cease to love you?" said her
aunt.</p>

<p>Hildegarde started; a quiver of pain passed over
the lovely face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cease to love me!" she repeated. "Ah! do you
know what would happen to me, auntie, if that were
to occur? I should die, that is all. When all was
gone that made life worth living, how could I live?"</p>

<p>"It is not easy to die," said Miss Fernly, huskily.</p>

<p>"It would be easy for me," declared Hildegarde.</p>

<p>"One can not live without a heart, and I have given
mine to my love."</p>

<p>She continued to talk of her lover in a sweet, girlish
fashion; but Miss Fernly scarcely heard a word she
said, she was so engrossed in her own thoughts and
plans.</p>

<p>"You would be so glad if you knew just how perfectly
happy I am, auntie," she went on, in a half-dreamy
fashion. "Why, it doesn't seem the same world
to me. He came into my life as the sun breaks upon
the flowers, suddenly, swiftly, and all at once my life
became complete. I met him on board the steamer. I
shall never forget how it came about. I had just come
upon deck, and was about to walk to the railing, when
the ship suddenly gave a lurch and I fell forward. I
would have fallen to the deck had not a young man who
was standing near-by sprung quickly forward and
caught me. That was the beginning of our acquaintance.
My mother, who had followed me on deck,
thanked him warmly. Love came to me swiftly. At the
first glance, when our eyes met, I knew that I had met
the only one in the world that I could ever love. I
loved him then with all my heart."</p>

<p>"Such a sudden love could not be a happy one; it
could not end happily."</p>

<p>The girl smiled.</p>

<p>"In most instances that is the case," replied Hildegarde.
"But in mine&mdash;mine&mdash;ah, Heaven is to be
thanked&mdash;mine is to be a happy love, and will have a
happy ending!"</p>

<p>Ah, if she had but known, if she had but guessed the
thoughts that filled Miss Fernly's heart, she might have
died then and there.</p>

<p>The sun set, and the dusk crept into the room; but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
was a subject that Hildegarde loved, and she could have
talked on forever about her lover.</p>

<p>"Mamma is quite late in returning," she said, at
length. "She may not even come home to dinner."</p>

<p>This proved to be the case. Hildegarde and her aunt
dined alone. She could not help but notice how her
niece watched the clock with the brightest of eyes, the
color deepening on her cheeks.</p>

<p>"I shall want to talk with this lover of yours
alone," said Miss Fernly, a trifle hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Will you want to talk to him long, auntie?"
asked her niece, wistfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, an hour, or perhaps two. I ordered my carriage
at seven; it will be here as soon as he arrives.
He will drive home with me, and can talk with me in
the carriage."</p>

<p>Hildegarde was a little surprised at this announcement,
but it did not occur to her to offer any objection.</p>

<p>"Ah, here he comes <i>now</i>!" cried Hildegarde, blushing
furiously, all in a flutter of delight.</p>

<p>In a moment it seemed to her that her aunt had
donned her hat and mantle. She was at the door as
soon as the servant, dragging Hildegarde by the arm.</p>

<p>Eugene Mallard was surprised to see Hildegarde
coming to the door to meet him. Then his eyes fell
upon the tall, austere woman in the rear.</p>

<p>He felt intuitively that this must be the aunt of
whom Hildegarde was always speaking. Even before
he heard the hurried words of introduction, the young
man held out his hand with a cordial smile.</p>

<p>"I am most pleased to meet you, Miss Fernly," he
said. "I have heard Hildegarde speak of you so
much that I feel as if I really knew and loved you
already."</p>

<p>Was it only his fancy, or was the greeting of Hildegarde's
aunt a trifle chilly?</p>

<p>"You are to accompany my aunt to her home," said
his <i>fiance</i>; adding, with a little twinkle in her eye:
"Auntie has something to say to you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>For a moment he looked crestfallen; then he added,
gallantly:</p>

<p>"I shall be most pleased. Pray command me, Miss
Fernly."</p>

<p>Another moment, and they were seated in the carriage.
He began to talk brightly to his companion;
but to his great surprise, she answered him only in
monosyllables.</p>

<p>"I am very much afraid she does not like me," he
thought, with some consternation, and he redoubled
his efforts to be agreeable. Any one who was related
in any way to his darling Hildegarde was dear to him.
He was always liked by women; he hoped from the
depths of his heart that this lady would not form an
aversion to him. But somehow he felt a cold, uncomfortable
chill creeping over his heart. Was it a premonition
of the evil that was so soon to come?</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>


<p>Although Eugene Mallard tried his best to entertain
Hildegarde's aunt as they rode along, it seemed
to him an almost impossible undertaking. She stared
at him too intently that he wondered what she was
thinking of. He thought it might be as to whether he
would make Hildegarde a good husband, and he
wished with all his heart to set her doubts at rest on
this point, so he began to talk of Hildegarde, and tell
her how much he thought of her.</p>

<p>The more he spoke of her niece, the sterner Miss
Fernly's face seemed to grow.</p>

<p>He was wondering to himself how long she would
detain him, he longed so for to return to Hildegarde,
who he knew was waiting for him with the utmost impatience.</p>

<p>Suddenly Miss Fernly turned to him.</p>

<p>"You say you would do anything for Hildegarde's
good&mdash;for her future happiness?" she asked, slowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;certainly," he answered. "I would lay down
my life for her. No sacrifice would be too great for
me to make."</p>

<p>"You are sure of that?" she asked, quickly.</p>

<p>"There is no question of it," Hildegarde's lover answered,
promptly. "To save her from a moment's
pain, I would lay down twenty lives if I had them."</p>

<p>"Very well; I will soon put you to the test," thought
Miss Fernly.</p>

<p>Suddenly the carriage came to a stop. To the young
man's great surprise, he found, as he assisted Miss
Fernly to alight, that they were in front of a small and
unpretentious church.</p>

<p>"Step this way," she said, leading him round to the
door of the parsonage.</p>

<p>He had heard that Miss Fernly was very religious;
but her action now rather puzzled him. Still without
a thought of what the outcome might be, he followed
where she led.</p>

<p>She spoke hurriedly to the coachman, and with a
bow, he drove quickly away.</p>

<p>"The minister has been called suddenly away to a
sick person," said the girl who admitted them to the
parsonage. "He has begged me to say that he would
return within the hour."</p>

<p>The young man wondered what business she had with
the parson; but he made no comment, but followed her
into the parsonage. The reception room into which they
were shown was dimly lighted. Miss Fernly seemed to
be well acquainted there.</p>

<p>Mr. Mallard took the seat Miss Fernly indicated.</p>

<p>"I have something to say to you," she began, in a
hard, set voice. "I shall break right into the subject
at once. Your wedding with my niece is fixed for to-morrow
night, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Why should not your marriage take place to-night&mdash;<i>here</i>
and <i>now</i>?" she asked, looking intently at him.</p>

<p>For an instant he almost believed that the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
lady had taken leave of her senses. He stared at her
in the most complete bewilderment.</p>

<p>In a slow and emphatic voice she repeated her
words.</p>

<p>"My dear madame," he said, "I do not see how
that could possibly be. You know it is not to be a
<i>quiet</i> affair. Over five hundred invitations have been
issued."</p>

<p>"You will be married to-night, and let to-morrow
night take care of itself," said Miss Fernly, sternly.</p>

<p>Had Hildegarde sent her aunt to make this arrangement?
He could hardly believe his own senses. But
surely it must be so.</p>

<p>He remembered the twinkle in her eyes as she had
said.</p>

<p>"You are to ride with auntie, she has something to
say to you."</p>

<p>"I am so dumfounded, I do not know how to answer
you," he declared.</p>

<p>"You will not refuse me?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Refuse you! How could I refuse a request in
which my happiness is so much bound up?" he answered,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"It is well!" said Miss Fernly. "Your bride is on
the way here by this time."</p>

<p>"Is this idea one of <i>your</i> planning?" asked Hildegarde's
lover, curiously.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, very quickly.</p>

<p>It seemed a very strange proceeding to him, but he
then did not pretend to understand the ways of women.
He was only too anxious to carry out Hildegarde's
slightest wish. He was so deeply in love with her that he
did not question the strangeness of her aunt's action.</p>

<p>Before he had time to think over the matter, two
carriages drove up to the door from different directions.
Out of one stepped the minister, and from the
other a slender figure, robed in snowy white, and almost
enveloped in a white tulle veil.</p>

<p>He would have sprung to meet her, but Miss Fernly
held him back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not yet," she said. "She will meet us at the altar;
the minister will bring her in."</p>

<p>Miss Fernly seemed to be running this novel affair,
and he did not suppose that it would be worth while
to try to dissuade her, since she must have talked it
over with Hildegarde.</p>

<p>He followed her into the dimly lighted church, and
down the long aisle to the altar-rail. Only one light
was lighted, which left all the corners of the great
edifice in darkness and gloom.</p>

<p>He had naturally a great deal of nerve; but to save
his life he could not help a feeling of awe coming over
him.</p>

<p>Before he had time to say anything, he saw the minister
in his clerical robes coming from an opposite direction
with the bride-elect on his arm. His heart
throbbed, every pulse quickened; a moment more, and
they had advanced.</p>

<p>"My darling!" he cried, as he sprang forward and
clasped the trembling girl in his arms.</p>

<p>She tried to speak, but the words died away in her
throat. It seemed to Eugene Mallard that he was in
a dream. Even the girl who stood by his side seemed
scarcely real. The folds of the filmy veil almost concealed
her.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" asked the minister, opening the
book.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Eugene Mallard, promptly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Miss Fernly, speaking for the bride-elect.</p>

<p>The marriage ceremony was begun. Then came the
question solemnly, warningly, from the minister's lips:
"If any one knows aught why this man or woman
should not be united in holy wedlock, let him now
speak, or forever hold his peace!"</p>

<p>There was an ominous silence. Miss Fernly trembled.
She was doing a noble action in righting a terrible
wrong, she told herself, and there was no response to
the clergyman's appeal.</p>

<p>In a voice which seemed still more solemn, he pronounced
the two before him man and wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>The bridegroom caught the bride in his arms, and
he laughed gayly to see how she trembled in his embrace.</p>

<p>"My wife!" he cried, straining her to his heart.
"Sweet," he murmured in a voice just audible to his
bride, "to be the lover of the girl you love, is bliss; but
to be the husband of the girl you love, is heaven! Tell
me, Hildegarde, are you not as happy as I am?"</p>

<p>A low cry broke from the white lips of the girl he
held in his arms. The minister had stepped into the
parsonage in response to a summons from one of the
servants, and invited the newly wedded couple and
Miss Fernly to follow him.</p>

<p>He was not surprised that they held back a moment.
It seemed to be the custom with all new-married couples
to loiter for a moment in the dim shadows of the old
church. The critical moment of Miss Fernly's triumph
had come. She had done a noble action, she told herself.
But somehow she trembled at the thought of what
Eugene Mallard would do when he discovered that the
girl whom he had wedded was not the beautiful Hildegarde
but the cruelly wronged Ida May.</p>

<p>The young husband had drawn his bride beneath the
chandelier of the church, and all unmindful of Miss
Fernly's presence, he declared, rapturously:</p>

<p>"I must have a kiss from the lips of my wife."</p>

<p>As he spoke he drew aside her veil. One glance
at the face it had hidden&mdash;oh, so piteous to behold in
its awful pallor! and a cry, surely the most bitter that
ever broke from human lips, issued from Eugene Mallard's.
His arms fell from the supple figure, and he
drew back, crying hoarsely:</p>

<p>"You are <i>not</i> Hildegarde! Great God! what does this
mean? Who are you?"</p>

<p>Miss Fernly stepped forward.</p>

<p>"I wonder that you ask such a question!" she cried,
shrilly. "Look upon her, and behold for yourself the
young girl you <i>duped</i> and deserted! Now, thank
Heaven, she is your wedded wife!" she added, triumphantly.
"I have helped her to right her wrongs!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I never saw this young woman before!" cried
Eugene Mallard, striking his forehead with his clinched
hand. "There is some terrible mistake! Speak out!"
he cried to the girl at his side, who was trembling like
an aspen-leaf. "Who are you who has done this terrible
deed?"</p>

<p>Like one dying, the hapless bride fell on her knees at
Miss Fernly's feet.</p>

<p>"There is some terrible mistake!" she cried, wildly.
"I&mdash;I did not discover it until he drew back my veil.
He&mdash;is&mdash;not&mdash;the man!"</p>

<p>"Not the man?" repeated Miss Fernly, aghast, hardly
believing that she had heard aright, her eyes almost
starting from their sockets. "I&mdash;I do not understand!"
she cried, recoiling from the girl. "Do you mean that
the man you have just wedded, and the one to whom
you told me was the cause of wrecking your life, is not
one and the same?"</p>

<p>The girl shook her head, while Eugene Mallard
looked from one to the other like one in a dream from
which he was expecting to soon awake.</p>

<p>Miss Fernly caught her by the shoulder.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" she cried, hoarsely. "You assured
me that this man was the cause of all your
trouble, and now you dare to tell me that he is not the
one! And I&mdash;brought about this, making you his
wife! It was a trick of yours, you shameless creature,
to secure a husband for yourself. Quick! Be gone from
this sacred edifice ere I strike you down at my feet, you
most shameless outcast, you horrible creature!"</p>

<p>Ida May drew back in terror from the upraised hand.</p>

<p>"Hold!" cried Eugene Mallard, stepping between
them. "No matter what this poor creature has done,
she is, in the eyes of God and man, my wife!"</p>

<p>By a dexterous movement he had raised the poor girl
from her knees, and had swung her out of the reach of
the blow that had been meant for her. Despite his anguish,
it aroused all the pity and chivalry in his nature
to see how the poor thing clung to him in her terror.</p>

<p>"Save me from her wrath," she murmured, clinging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
to him with death-cold hands, and adding vehemently:
"Believe me, it was all a horrible mistake! I saw your
picture, and&mdash;and I mistook you for another. The
church was so dimly lighted, I&mdash;I could not see, and I
did not know the terrible mistake until&mdash;until it was
too late! Oh, tell me, tell me, what can I do to undo
the great wrong that I have done you?"</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h2>


<p>Eugene Mallard had sunk into the nearest seat, covering
his face with his hands. The horror of the situation
had just come to him. By the cruel working of
fate he had been wedded to one woman through a horrible
mistake, while his heart and soul were another's.</p>

<p>It seemed to him like some horrible dream from
which he must soon awake. He had parted from Hildegarde
full of hope and love, scarcely an hour before,
saying to himself, as he turned and looked back at her,
that ere the sun would rise and set again, she would be
his own, that they would never be parted from each
other after that. And now a barrier had suddenly risen
between them which parted them just as surely as
though one of them lay in the grave.</p>

<p>His whole soul was bound up in Hildegarde; yet he
was wedded to another. It seemed to him that the
anguish of it was more than he could bear.</p>

<p>Then came to him the thought that he must protect
the woman he had wedded&mdash;this poor young creature
who still clung to him, imploring him to save her from
Miss Fernly's wrath, repeating to him, over and over
again, that it was a mistake.</p>

<p>Eugene Mallard roused himself from the stupor
which was stealing over him. He must face the terrible
consequences of that rash marriage. Although this girl
had wrecked his life, ruined his future, yet he could not
find it in his heart to curse her.</p>

<p>He could not help but believe her&mdash;that it was some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
terrible mistake; he could not judge her before he knew
more about what had prompted her to do this deed.
He could not rest until he knew the reason that lay
behind it.</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it," he said, hoarsely, turning
to the girl, "that I may judge for myself of this action
of yours."</p>

<p>"Yes, tell him," cried Miss Fernly, "that I may be
cleared of my part in this transaction. You deceived
me as well."</p>

<p>In a faltering voice that sounded as though she were
dying, Ida May told her story, the man she had married
listening intently.</p>

<p>He did not speak until she had concluded, but Miss
Fernly saw that the girl's story was greatly affecting
him.</p>

<p>"No wonder you mistook me for Royal Ainsley, when
you saw that picture," he exclaimed, "for we are
cousins. The resemblance between us was most marked
when that picture was taken."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;thought the name Miss Fernly told me was
an assumed name, or else you had given me a false one."</p>

<p>Miss Fernly's self-control seemed to leave her entirely
as she listened.</p>

<p>"I am responsible for it!" she groaned, wringing her
hands. "Oh, what will Hildegarde and my sister say!"</p>

<p>Eugene Mallard and Miss Fernly looked into each
other's faces, and their lips were mute.</p>

<p>"Let me go to her and tell her my story," sobbed the
hapless bride, "then I will go away, and you shall never
look upon my face again!"</p>

<p>"That would not mend matters," replied Eugene Mallard.
"I have married you, and nothing can undo
that."</p>

<p>"Oh, do not say so!" cried Ida May. "I will free you
from the bond whose links have just been forged. You
shall have a divorce. I will set you free!"</p>

<p>Eugene Mallard shook his head.</p>

<p>"You would do so if you could," he answered;
"but, alas! you can not. Those whom God hath joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
together no one has the right to put asunder."</p>

<p>With a sigh that nearly rent his heart, he rose to
his feet. The carriage still stood in waiting at the
door.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked Miss Fernly.</p>

<p>"We will all three go to Hildegarde, and break it
as gently as we can to her&mdash;tell her what has happened&mdash;break
the sad story to her as gently as we
can," Eugene repeated.</p>

<p>As one whose feet refused to do her bidding, Miss
Fernly tottered up the aisle behind them. What would
Hildegarde say&mdash;what would she do? Perhaps she
would fall dead at their feet, for she loved, with all the
passionate love of her heart, the man whom she had
promised to wed on the morrow.</p>

<p>"Oh, if I had not been so hasty!" cried Miss Fernly.
"I meant to do a noble action, but instead I have
wrecked two lives!"</p>

<p>They entered the carriage in silence&mdash;a silence which
was not broken until they reached the door of the
beautiful Cramer mansion. They saw Hildegarde
standing at the lace-draped window, peering out into
the darkness, eagerly watching for them.</p>

<p>The hapless young lover groaned aloud. Miss Fernly
hid her face in her hands. Hildegarde was at the door
to greet them almost as soon as the servant.</p>

<p>"You have been gone very long, Eugene!" she cried.
"Dear me! how surprised I was to see Aunt Fernly returning
with you!"</p>

<p>Then her eyes fell upon the girl in bridal robes her
lover was holding by the hand. She did not recognise
Ida May because of the veil which she had drawn down
over her face, nor did she hear the cry of surprise Ida
May uttered when she recognized her.</p>

<p>Miss Fernly had always spoken of the bride to be as
her niece, but had never once mentioned her name.</p>

<p>For one moment Ida May stood irresolute. She now
realized what she had done, and wondered how Hildegarde
would take the terrible mistake.</p>

<p>For a moment the three stood silent. Who would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
be the one to break the terrible news to Hildegarde?</p>

<p>"What is the matter, and who is this beautiful
young girl, clad in bridal robes, whom you hold by
the hand, Eugene?"</p>

<p>He tried to speak, but he could not utter a word
if his life had depended upon it. Even Miss Fernly
seemed to have been stricken dumb. Ida May knew
that it devolved upon her to utter the words which
would stab Hildegarde Cramer to the very soul. She
saw the lover try to speak, and fail, and also saw Miss
Fernly's lips twitch convulsively.</p>

<p>Nerving herself for the ordeal through which she
must pass, she stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Let <i>me</i> answer for them," she said, in a voice that
sounded to Hildegarde's ears like the strain of some
half-forgotten melody. And as she uttered the words
she threw back her veil.</p>

<p>"Ida May!" cried Hildegarde, aghast.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am that hapless creature whom you knew
as Ida May."</p>

<p>For an instant there was silence, broken only by
the sound of the labored breathing of Miss Fernly,
Hildegarde, and Eugene Mallard.</p>

<p>In an instant the haughty heiress had recovered
herself. She recoiled from the girl who advanced
pleadingly before her.</p>

<p>"Hildegarde! Hildegarde!" Ida cried, much to the
astonishment of Miss Fernly and her companion, "I
did not know that it was you whom I was to confront
in this awful hour!"</p>

<p>But Hildegarde shrunk still further from her. How
dared this creature, who had passed those weeks at
Newport a living lie, to claim acquaintance with her!</p>

<p>She flushed crimson, and retreated from her in abhorrence,
wondering how this creature had come here,
accompanied by her aunt and lover.</p>

<p>"Hildegarde!" cried Ida May, "listen, for the love
of Heaven, and do not judge me too harshly until you
have heard all!"</p>

<p>Sobbing wildly, Ida caught at the hem of Hilde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>garde's dress.</p>

<p>"Auntie!" cried Hildegarde, turning to her relative,
"I do not care to listen to anything this&mdash;this
person has to say. The very air she breathes stifles me.
Eugene!" she cried, springing to her lover's side,
"take me in to the drawing-room. I&mdash;I can not talk
to this young girl."</p>

<p>He did not clasp her in his arms, though he made a
movement to do so. His arms fell to his sides, and his
head drooped to his breast.</p>

<p>He was enduring torture so acute that many a man
would have fainted under the strain of it.</p>

<p>Hildegarde looked up into his face in wonder.</p>

<p>"Eugene, my darling!" she cried "are you ill? Tell
me! Something terrible must be the matter! Why do
you not speak?"</p>

<p>In that instant she seemed to forget the presence of
everybody, save the lover who had parted from her a
few hours since, and who was now standing before her
so greatly changed.</p>

<p>She looked from one to the other in consternation.</p>

<p>"Something has happened," she said. "Why do you
keep me in suspense?"</p>

<p>"I am trying to tell you," sobbed Ida May, "but you
will not listen."</p>

<p>"Must I listen to her, auntie?" cried Hildegarde,
turning to her aunt.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Miss Fernly, "you must listen, my
poor child, while I pray to Heaven to give you strength
to bear it."</p>

<p>"Eugene!" cried the girl, "why are you silent?"</p>

<p>He could not answer her. He only looked at her with
a world of woe in his gaze, his whole frame trembling
with anguish.</p>

<p>Ida May never knew in what words she told her
strange story. Hildegarde listened like one turned to
stone. Ida May told her of the awful mistake that
had blasted two lives and parted two who fondly loved
each other.</p>

<p>Those who saw the look of pity in the face of Hildegarde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
would never forget it.</p>

<p>Her face became as pale as marble; the blood receded
from the ripe-red lips.</p>

<p>She passed through a life-time of woe in those few
minutes. She did not look at Ida May or her lover
when the former ceased speaking, but she turned her
white, set, tragic face to her aunt.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> have done this dreadful thing!" she cried. "I
wonder that Heaven does not strike you dead for it!"</p>

<p>"Hildegarde! Hildegarde!" cried Miss Fernly, "I
would only be too glad to give my life to atone for my
part in this dreadful affair."</p>

<p>The girl looked at her with eyes like jets of flame.</p>

<p>"If you had but told me," she said, in a voice that
was more sorrowful than any tears could have been.
"You took the reins into your own hands; you meddled
with the affairs of another, and see the mischief
you have wrought!"</p>

<p>A sort of frenzy seemed to possess her.</p>

<p>"Go!" she cried, turning to Ida May, and pointing
toward the door. "Get out of this house, out of my
sight, before I call the servants to fling you into the
street!"</p>

<p>Ida May crept toward the door. To Hildegarde's intense
surprise, Eugene Mallard turned to follow her.</p>

<p>"I will go with you," he said, huskily, "for you&mdash;you
are my&mdash;my wife!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</a></h2>


<p>"Yes; where she goes, I must follow," repeated
Eugene Mallard, in a voice husky with emotion, "for
she is my wife!"</p>

<p>The words fell upon Hildegarde's ears with a dreadful
shock. It was not until then that she realized her
lover was separated from her.</p>

<p>She saw him take Ida May's hand and lead her
slowly out of the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>In the years that followed she wondered that the
sight did not kill her.</p>

<p>When the door closed after them, Hildegarde stood
for a moment stunned, with a white, awful pallor on
her face.</p>

<p>Miss Fernly watched her in silence.</p>

<p>Was Hildegarde going mad? If she would only cry
out, utter some word. But no; only that awful silence.
"Hildegarde," said Miss Fernly, approaching her
tremblingly, "what can I say, what can I do, to repair
the terrible wrong I have done you?"</p>

<p>"The only thing you can do is to kill me," answered
the girl, in a hoarse, unnatural voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, my niece! my precious niece, do not say that!"
replied Miss Fernly, beside herself with grief. "You
will break my heart!"</p>

<p>"Yours is not the only one that will be broken," returned
Hildegarde.</p>

<p>Miss Fernly attempted to approach her, but Hildegarde
drew back in loathing.</p>

<p>"Do not come near me!" she cried, with flashing
eyes, "lest I forget who you are, and strike you dead
at my feet!"</p>

<p>With a quick motion, Hildegarde turned, and without
another word, flew up the staircase and up to her
own <i>boudoir</i>, and closed the door securely after her.</p>

<p>"Let me realize it," she murmured. "A few hours
ago I was the happiest girl the world held; now I cry
out to Heaven to end my life."</p>

<p>She crept up to the mirror, and she stood before it,
tall, slender, and erect in the dignity of her own despair,
her face white, her dark eyes dark with sorrow.</p>

<p>"Can that be me?" she murmured, crossing her
hands over her breast. But the figure reflected gave
back no answer.</p>

<p>"He has gone out of my life. What am I to do?"
she murmured. "One can never be sure of anything
in this world. He left me only a few hours ago, and
there was nothing between us but love. I can not believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
it! It is some awful dream from which I shall
presently awake!"</p>

<p>She wrung her hands wildly; she tore her beautiful
dark hair; she was as one mad with anguish. Then
she thought of Ida May, and she clinched her hands.</p>

<p>Some one knocked at the door</p>

<p>"Let me in, Hildegarde!" cried her mother, anxiously.</p>

<p>"No!" answered the girl. "I can not&mdash;do not ask
me. Only leave me here alone. The sight of human
faces, the sound of human voices, would drive me
mad!"</p>

<p>All in vain the mother pleaded. Suddenly she
heard a fall, and when one of the servants whom Mrs.
Cramer had summoned burst open the door, she found
Hildegarde lying face downward on the velvet carpet.</p>

<p>Miss Fernly had told her sister all, made a clean
breast of the whole affair. But Hildegarde's mother
did not curse her, as she feared she might do. She only
looked at her sister with horror-stricken eyes.</p>

<p>For a fortnight Hildegarde lay on the bed where
they had placed her.</p>

<p>The doctor had worked over her for hours.</p>

<p>"She is young," he said to the heart-broken mother,
"and while there is life there is hope."</p>

<p>When she arose from her bed, every one was startled
at the change in her. She made no complaint, even to
Miss Fernly, who hovered around her in an agony more
pitiful than words can describe.</p>

<p>Hildegarde was like one on whom the shadow of
death had fallen. She grew thin and white; the light
was gone from her beautiful eyes, the color from her
beautiful face.</p>

<p>No smile, no sound of laughter, came to the pale lips.
If her mother, whose heart ached over her beloved child,
tried to cheer her, she had but one answer for her, and
it was:</p>

<p>"I shall die soon, my heart is slowly bleeding to
death."</p>

<p>Then came the announcement that Hildegarde was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
going abroad. But the paper did not state how long she
would remain.</p>

<p>This looked very serious indeed to the friends who
had hoped against all hope.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cramer was anxious that none of her companions
should behold her, she was so terribly altered. She
could not bear the criticisms which she knew her appearance
would be sure to occasion. But Hildegarde
had stoutly declared she would not go abroad.</p>

<p>"I want to die in my native land," pleaded the girl,
piteously.</p>

<p>She sought her couch early, because her mother was
anxious about her; but her mother did not know that
she paced the floor until the gray dawn.</p>

<p>Now her mother hastened the preparations for the
trip abroad.</p>

<p>"She is young, and a change of air and scene will
surely bring about forgetfulness," thought Mrs.
Cramer.</p>

<p>It was well for her that she could not foresee what
was to happen in the near future.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</a></h2>


<p>We must return to Ida May, dear reader, and picture
to you the awful woe she experienced as she
turned from Hildegarde, saying. "Let me go away
out of your lives; if my life could atone for what I
have done, I would give it."</p>

<p>She scarcely heard Eugene Mallard's words,
"Where you go, I must follow, for you are my wife."</p>

<p>She was unaware of his presence, until fleeing down
the graveled walk, she heard a step behind her, and
a firm hand caught her arm. Turning, she saw the
man whom she had just wedded.</p>

<p>She drew back in fear and trembling. He noticed
her action, and despite his bitter woe he could not
but feel sorry for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"We can not undo what has been done, my poor
girl," he said. "It was a terrible mistake, but we
must face it bravely."</p>

<p>She looked up into his face with wistful eyes.</p>

<p>"If you would only kill me here and now, I would
be so grateful to you. No one would ever know. My
life is of so little account that not one in the whole
world would miss me or grieve for me, and then you
could marry Hildegarde!"</p>

<p>He drew back shocked.</p>

<p>"You must not speak in that way," he said. "The
life of every human being is sacred. You are entitled
to your life, no matter what has happened, until God
calls you. I do not blame you, my poor girl, for what
has happened. I only say we must try to face the
future, and to see what can be done."</p>

<p>Before he could realize what she was about to do,
she had flung herself on her knees at his feet, and
covered his hands with kisses. Her heart was full of
the deepest gratitude to him. He was the only being
who had ever spoken kindly to her of late.</p>

<p>He raised her gently.</p>

<p>"You should not kneel to me," he said, "it is not
right."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will!" she cried, impulsively. "You are
good&mdash;you are noble. You do not curse me for what
I could not help. I want to show you how bitterly I
deplore what has been done! But how are you to realize
it?"</p>

<p>While they were speaking, a few drops of rain fell
from the heavens, and Ida May, looking up, said to
herself that even the angels above were weeping for
her.</p>

<p>"Come!" he said, taking her by the hand and leading
her along as though she were a little child, "you
can not stand out in the rain. Come with me!"</p>

<p>He hailed a passing cab and placed her in it.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" she asked, timidly, looking
up into his troubled face.</p>

<p>"I do not know until I have had time to think," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
answered. "I have told the driver to drive about for
an hour. By that time I shall have arrived at some
conclusion."</p>

<p>The girl's dark head drooped. Great as her own
sorrow was, her heart bled for the trouble which she
had unintentionally caused this young man.</p>

<p>On and on rolled the cab. So busy was Eugene Mallard
with his own troubled thoughts that he almost
forgot the girl shrinking away in her corner, who was
regarding him so piteously and anxiously.</p>

<p>Suddenly he turned to her.</p>

<p>"There is but one course left open to us," he said,
huskily, "and that we must follow. You are my wife,
and I must take you to the home that has been prepared
to receive my bride."</p>

<p>She uttered a low cry; but before she could speak, he
hastened to add:</p>

<p>"No advantage shall be taken of the position in
which you are so strangely placed. You shall be my
wife in the eyes of the world, but to me you shall be
just as sacred as a sister. We will live our lives
through in this way."</p>

<p>She bowed her head. Whatever he suggested must
be wisest and best, she thought.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I can see no other way out of it at the
present outlook," he went on, his voice trembling a
little. "I will take you to a hotel near where I am
stopping. To-morrow, at this time, I will come for you
to take the train with me!"</p>

<p>A little later Ida found herself alone in the comfortable
room which he had secured for her at the hotel.</p>

<p>It was then and not until then that the poor girl gave
vent to her grief, suffering almost as deeply as did
Hildegarde, as the long hours of the night passed away.</p>

<p>The sun was shining bright and warm when she
opened her eyes the next morning. For a moment she
was dazed and bewildered; then a rush of memory came
to her, and she remembered all that had taken place.
She sprung from her couch with a bitter sob on her lips.
Some one tapped at the door. It was the chamber-maid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your breakfast is to be served to you here, ma'am,"
she said. "The waiter is bringing it. I will take it
from him. Here are also some large packages which
arrived for you."</p>

<p>"Thank you!" murmured the girl. "Just put them
on the table. But stay," she added in the next breath;
"you may as well open them. I do not think they are
for me."</p>

<p>With deft fingers the girl unwrapped the bundle, and
held up to her astonished gaze a beautiful brown traveling
suit of the finest cloth, with hat, shoes, gloves, and
<i>lingerie</i> to match. Gazing upon the outfit with wide-opened
eyes, she forgot her sorrow for the moment.</p>

<p>This was another proof of the thoughtfulness and
kindness of the man whose life she had wrecked.</p>

<p>"What a superb traveling-dress!" cried the maid,
with delight. "I have never seen anything like it. And
the hat; why, it is a veritable dream, madame. It is so
exquisitely dainty! There is something in the pocket
of the dress!" exclaimed the maid. "Does madame
wish me to see what it is?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ida.</p>

<p>The next moment the girl had produced a tiny
box. On a bed of violet velvet reposed a band of plain
gold. Within were the engraved words: "My
wife!"</p>

<p>The poor girl caught her breath with a sob as the
maid handed it to her. The color came and went on
her face; her eyes grew dim with tears. It was with
the greatest difficulty that she succeeded in hiding
her emotion from the maid, whose eyes were intently
fixed on her.</p>

<p>"I thought she was a single young girl," she
thought, "but she seems to be married."</p>

<p>Ida May turned away; she could not bear to have
any one see her emotion.</p>

<p>"I can not accept it, nor any of his gifts, because
I can not make use of them," she thought. "I am
going away from here, going out of his life. I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
not go with him to his Southern home; I have no
right there!"</p>

<p>When the maid came to her, and asked her if she
wished all her meals served in her room, she mechanically
answered, "Yes." Tempting dishes were
brought, but they went back untasted.</p>

<p>"The lady in Room 27 seems very ill," said the
chamber-maid, when she went down to the servant's
hall below. "She is <i>very</i> mysterious. Her eyes are
so big, so black, and so mournful, you are sure she is
going to burst into tears at every word she utters.
She looks like a creature who has passed through
some great sorrow. With the exception of <i>one</i> lady,
I never saw any-one else look like that. And oh, mercy!
she had the same room too&mdash;No. 27.</p>

<p>"This woman left word that I was to come to her
in the morning. To my great surprise, I found the
door open as I turned the knob. As I went forward
to awaken her, I saw the still form lying on the bed.
As I approached, I saw, to my great amazement, that
her eyes were wide open and staring at me.</p>

<p>"'I beg your pardon for not coming sooner,
ma'am,' I said. 'I did not think you would be awake
so early. There&mdash;'</p>

<p>"The rest of the sentence was never finished. I saw
that the eyes staring up into mine were glazed in
death. The scream I uttered brought half the people
in the hotel to the scene, a physician being among
them.</p>

<p>"He said that the young lady had been dead some
hours. She had taken poison. The mystery surrounding
her&mdash;who she was, and whence she came, has never
been solved from that day to this. There is much the
same look in this lady's face as there was in that other
one's. I think she will bear watching.</p>

<p>"You know, too, that nine out of ten of the people
who think of committing suicide choose a hotel in which
to commit the deed. This young lady in No. 27 seems
to be dazed. She scarcely knows what one is speaking
to her about."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Having told her story, the chamber-maid left the
room, shaking her head as she went. The clerk of the
hotel, who was passing through the corridor, and who
had heard the story was a little annoyed over it. He
knew the habit of the maids to gossip; still, there might
be some truth in the story.</p>

<p>It would certainly not be amiss to look into the matter
a little. He remembered a tall and handsome gentleman
had made arrangements for the lady, paying her
bills in advance.</p>

<p>He thought he would wait a day and then speak to
the proprietor concerning the matter.</p>

<p>The sunshine of the afternoon faded; the gloaming
crept up, deepening into the soft beauty of the starry
night.</p>

<p>As the hours rolled by, the girl made a resolve to end
it all.</p>

<p>She arose quietly and donned the dark cloak which
Miss Fernly had wrapped about her as they stepped
from the rector's cottage. She was glad to have it
now, for it would cover the bridal robes which she had
donned. Her bridegroom was to be death!</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.</a></h2>


<p>With trembling hands, this hapless girl, who had
taken such a terrible resolve, opened the door of her
room, and glided softly down the long corridor and out
of the hotel.</p>

<p>Ida May had scarcely gained the street before a
carriage drove up, and Eugene Mallard sprung from it.
He was surprised at seeing Ida advancing to meet him.
She drew back with a cry.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" he asked; but before she could
answer, he went on: "You do not wear your traveling-dress.
Was there anything amiss with it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>She tried to keep back the sobs from her lips; but
almost before she was aware of it, she had confessed to
him that she was about to flee from him.</p>

<p>Standing there, very gently and patiently, he went
over the ground with her, insisting upon her following
out their original plan; and the upshot of it all was,
she returned to her room, donned her traveling-dress,
joined him again, and took a seat beside him in the carriage.</p>

<p>A little later the railway station was reached, and
they were soon whirling away toward the mysteries
of the future.</p>

<p>"We will reach our destination a little before midnight,"
Eugene said, seating himself opposite her.
"There will be a number of old friends at the station
to give my bride a welcome home," he added in a
voice that was husky, despite his efforts at self-control;
and Ida knew that he was thinking of that <i>other</i>
bride whom he had intended to bring to them, and she
felt most wretched at the effort he was making to
look the present difficulty in the face and bear up
under it.</p>

<p>How he must loathe her! Her very presence most
be hateful to him! The thought of that made her
shrink still further from Eugene Mallard.</p>

<p>She felt like opening the car window and springing
from it out into the blackness of the night. Then he
would be free to marry Hildegarde. On and on
through the darkness rushed the express.</p>

<p>"The next station will be ours," he said at length.
Ida looked up in apprehension. There would be a
party of friends awaiting Eugene's home-coming; but,
ah! what would they say when they saw that it was
not Hildegarde whom he had wedded? Had he a
mother&mdash;had he sisters?</p>

<p>Perhaps he divined her thoughts, for quite as soon
as they had flashed through her brain he turned to
her, and said, abruptly:</p>

<p>"I have told you nothing of my home life. It was
an oversight on my part, possibly because the idea did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
not occur to me. I have no relatives upon the face of
the earth, except the scape grace cousin you know of.
From my uncle I inherited the Virginia home to which
I am taking you. It is presided over by Mrs. Rice, an
old lady who has served in the capacity of housekeeper
for twenty years. All the servants have been in the
household quite as long a time. They are good and
faithful to me. They will receive you warmly. Your
word shall be their law. No one outside the household
will know of our strained relationship. The secret will
be kept faithfully from the world by the members of
my household."</p>

<p>"I do not deserve so much consideration at your
hands," murmured the girl.</p>

<p>Before he had time to reply, their station was
reached. There were few people at the station owing
to the lateness of the hour.</p>

<p>An old-fashioned carry-all was waiting at the rear.
Peering out from it was the face of old Black Joe.</p>

<p>"Welcome, marse! welcome!" he cried. "An' a
thousand welcomes to the lovely young missus, your
bride! There's a great company at the house, sir,
awaiting you both."</p>

<p>Eugene Mallard thanked the old colored servant for
his kind wishes for himself and bride, as he helped Ida
into the vehicle.</p>

<p>There was a long ride over a rough mountain road,
during which time, much to old Black Joe's surprise,
scarcely a word was exchanged between the bride and
groom, and it puzzled the good old man.</p>

<p>Was the lady ill? So great was his concern over it,
that he was tempted to ask his master the question a
dozen times. But prudence restrained him.</p>

<p>At length, in turning an abrupt curve in the road,
a gray stone mansion, fairly ablaze with lights from
cellar to dome, loomed in sight&mdash;lights that twinkled
like glow-worms in the distance. They could hear the
strains of music, and as they approached they could
even hear the sound of voices.</p>

<p>Still no word was uttered by either of them.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.</a></h2>


<p>In less time than it takes to tell it, the strained relationship
between Eugene Mallard and his bride was
whispered through the household. They had laughed
at old Black Joe when he had whispered the story of
their silence from the railroad station, declaring he
was romancing. Later events certainly gave color to
the story, however. She was all that was sweet and
fair. What could be the trouble?</p>

<p>"If there was ever a bride most wretchedly unhappy,
she is that one," said Mrs. Rice, shaking her head.</p>

<p>"Why did he marry her if he did not love her? I
can not understand it, I am sure."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rice went to the bride's room the next morning
to awaken her. She found her already up and sitting
by the window, and there was no indication that she
had removed her dress. This was reduced to a certainty
when she went into the adjoining apartment and found
the couch just as it had been the previous evening.</p>

<p>She went back to where young Mrs. Mallard was
sitting, and laid her hand gently upon the girl's arm.</p>

<p>"I hope you will be happy with us here, my dear,"
she said in her sweet, gentle old voice, "for we will do
everything to serve you. I have been here for many
years and have witnessed the home-coming of many of
the brides of the Mallards. There was never one that
I took to more than I did to you, my dear child. I felt
like taking you in my arms and pressing you to my
heart. But you seem lonely. Tell me, is there anything
I can do for you?"</p>

<p>Ida lifted her face.</p>

<p>"You are very, very kind," she said, gratefully, "and
I thank you with all my heart."</p>

<p>She looked as if she were about to add something, but
quickly checked herself.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would like to see the grounds, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
dear," said Mrs. Rice. "Will you come out into the
garden?"</p>

<p>The young woman acquiesced readily enough.</p>

<p>"Your trunks have not come yet, my dear," said
Mrs. Rice, as they walked along. "The railway service
in this part of the country is abominable. It looks
strange to have you come down to breakfast in your
traveling-dress, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have no trunks coming. This is the only dress I
have to wear at present," returned the girl, quietly.</p>

<p>It was as much as the old housekeeper could do to
restrain herself from an exclamation of astonishment at
this announcement.</p>

<p>What could it mean? Why had Eugene Mallard's
bride no <i>trousseau</i>, as he had been preparing for this
event for months, as eager in his anticipation of it as
a school-boy for a holiday! She could not understand
it; she felt mystified. But with the quick wit habitual
to her, Mrs. Rice replied almost instantly:</p>

<p>"A wardrobe can be easily supplied by our Virginia
<i>modistes</i>. Indeed, they are world-famous, I may add.
They make dresses for many of the ladies of Washington
on the shortest notice. Mr. Mallard pressed a roll of
bills into my hand when he arrived, and said: 'See that
my wife has everything needful, Mrs. Rice.' I could not
think what he meant at the time. Now I see it was your
wardrobe he referred to. You and I will set about getting
the things at once. Or if it will fatigue you too
much after your journey, you leave it to me, and I will
see that you have a complete wardrobe in a short time.
You must not say no, my dear; for remember, it is your
husband's wish, and you surely wish to please him."</p>

<p>The girl looked at her with the strangest expression
in her dark eyes.</p>

<p>"Nothing that I could do would please him," she said,
hopelessly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rice did not tell that remark to the servants, or
there would have been no end of gossip among them.</p>

<p>"There is some great mystery between Eugene Mallard
and his bride," she said to herself. "I will not attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
to probe into the mystery, but I will endeavor to
bring them together, if it lies within human power."</p>

<p>The fortnight that followed, the old mansion was
fairly alive with guests coming and going.</p>

<p>Eugene Mallard could not help but admire Ida for
bearing up so bravely under the terrible ordeal. During
that fortnight a strange thing happened&mdash;the
cruelest blow that Heaven could have dealt Ida. The
lovely girl had learned to love Eugene Mallard with
all the strength of her nature. She was in love with
him, and he was cold and indifferent.</p>

<p>Another fortnight passed, and yet another. Everything
at the great mansion passed pleasantly enough to
the outside world. But the young girls for miles
around who envied the young bride never dreamed of
the skeleton that existed in that magnificent mansion.</p>

<p>Eugene Mallard was all that was kind and considerate.
It seemed a necessity to him to have the house
full of company. He was never alone with Ida. How
gayly he talked to his guests! Looking at him, Ida
said to herself:</p>

<p>"If he would but smile so when he speaks to me!
His eyes are always cold; no warmth or brightness ever
comes into them for me."</p>

<p>Although Eugene Mallard appeared so bright and
gay before his guests; yet, unknown to any one, his
heart was filled with the bitterness of death. It did
not seem possible for him to live through the hours day
after day. He felt thankful to Heaven that no one
guessed that he had brought home a different bride
from what he had intended. He dashed recklessly from
one gayety to another, his object being to try to forget
Hildegarde, his love. He never voluntarily looked at
the girl he had married.</p>

<p>At the end of six weeks most of the guests returned
to their homes, and Eugene Mallard suddenly found
himself alone with his young wife and the servants.</p>

<p>"I must not let this happen again," he said. "To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
live here alone requires more strength than I am possessed
of."</p>

<p>They breakfasted alone in the great oak dining-room,
and each felt the restraint which they could illy conceal.</p>

<p>As she took her place at the table she was perfectly
calm and self-possessed, but the mask of smiles she had
worn before his guests fell from her face. She did not
attempt any conversation with him, but with a quick,
flashing smile she answered when she was spoken to.</p>

<p>"It seems to take the servants exceptionally long to
serve breakfast," he said, impatiently; adding: "Will
you permit me to glance over the morning paper? I
am interested in this column on stocks."</p>

<p>She bowed her head gracefully, and watched him, as
he read in silence. There came over her face an air of
sadness painful to see in one so young.</p>

<p>To Ida the departure of the company was a great relief.
Indeed, she longed for solitude, and thought that
if they did not go soon she could not keep up much
longer.</p>

<p>She had wanted to go away long ago; but she had remained
there, and now the attraction was so great that
she would not break away even if she could. Her love
for her husband was like a magnet, strong as her very
life-blood, a part of every heart-beat.</p>

<p>For long hours she would muse over her strange position.</p>

<p>It was an uncommon fate&mdash;young, with life all before
her, she longed for its blessings. It was pitiful for her
to know that the man she had learned to love cared for
another, that she was no more to her husband than she
would be to a brother.</p>

<p>How sad it was that she should long for the love of
her husband as she had never longed for anything else
in life! It seemed so strange to live in that magnificent
home, to have everything that her heart desired,
to be wealthy, honored, and envied, yet to have no husband's
love.</p>

<p>Did he still sigh for Hildegarde? Was he thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
of her when that dreamy look came into his eyes? She
would give the world to know. She felt a terrible
jealousy in her heart.</p>

<p>"Will he never change?" she asked herself, in despair.
"Living under the same roof with me, seeing me
day after day, will his heart never warm ever so little
toward me?"</p>

<p>Once more the old resolve, to steal away from the
house, came to her. Should she go to him, kneel at his
feet, and sob out:</p>

<p>"I can not remain in this house any longer, because
I&mdash;I&mdash;have learned to love you!"</p>

<p>She could picture the surprise on his face. Perhaps
there would be anger, scorn. The eagle dared to look
at the sun, the worm dared to creep into the tender
heart of the rose. Was it strange that she had dared to
love him?</p>

<p>Hers was a dreary fate, and she tried to bear it
bravely. If she had only some one to confide in, some
one to talk to! Was his heart dead because of his bitter
disappointment?</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a></h2>


<p>One morning Eugene Mallard informed his young
wife at the breakfast-table that he had invited a party
of friends from the adjoining city, and had just received
word that they would be with them that day.
This was sorrowful news to Ida, for she realized that she
would see less of her husband when they came. But he
seemed to await their arrival in a fever of impatience.</p>

<p>While she was wondering how many there would be
in the party, her husband said, as if in answer to the
unexpressed thought:</p>

<p>"There will be six in the party&mdash;Mrs. Staples and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
two daughters, Dora and Louisa, Captain Drury, Arthur
Hollis, and&mdash;and Vivian Deane."</p>

<p>Ida looked up quickly as her husband pronounced the
last name. Was it only her fancy, or did he turn away
abruptly?</p>

<p>Somehow she could not rid herself of the fancy.</p>

<p>Then suddenly it occurred to her that she had heard
the name, Vivian Deane, before. She remembered the
conversation well.</p>

<p>While their former guests were there, she had been
sitting in the rose-embowered veranda one day, while
two of them passed on the lawn, and the fragments of
their conversation floated up to her.</p>

<p>"I am surprised to find that Vivian Deane is not
here," said one.</p>

<p>"Indeed! I would have been more surprised if she
had been here," said the other.</p>

<p>They were idle words, almost meaningless, as far as
she was concerned, but the name, Vivian Deane, clung
to her for many days afterward. This was the last
morning she would have with her husband. It was
generally his custom to smoke in the grounds after
breakfast. If she walked over the lawn she might be
able to have a little chat with him.</p>

<p>She made a tour of the grounds, but to her surprise
she did not see Eugene Mallard. Perhaps he was detained
in the library writing letters. A little brook
ran through a far corner of the grounds, and on either
side of it tall laurel bushes grew.</p>

<p>Would life ever be any different for her? Would
fate be always as unkind as now? Bitter tears, which
she could not restrain, sprung to her eyes and coursed
down her cheeks.</p>

<p>She tried to stop their flow, but she could not, though
she realized that they would be a sorry object before
her husband's guests. At that moment she heard the
sound of footsteps.</p>

<p>Looking through the bushes she saw two of the servants
walking leisurely along, one carrying a basket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
of newly gathered fruit, and the other a basket of
freshly cut roses.</p>

<p>Was it fate that caused one of them to say:</p>

<p>"Let us not return to the house just yet. The morning
is warm and fine, why not sit down here under the
shade of this tree and tie the roses into bunches? I
can do it as well here as in the house."</p>

<p>Whereupon they leisurely proceeded to seat themselves.</p>

<p>"It isn't the same house since master brought home
his bride," said the other. "It's nothing but company,
company, all the time. Now we are to have another new
lot of guests."</p>

<p>"And guess who is invited <i>this</i> time," said her companion.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mallard seems to know everybody in the country,
so it would be a pretty hard guess," laughed the
girl.</p>

<p>"Well," returned the other, "as you are not so good
at guessing, I may as well tell you&mdash;it is Miss Vivian
Deane."</p>

<p>"Pray, who is <i>she</i>?" asked the girl who was tying
the roses.</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot you were not here long enough to
know about her. Well, I will tell you. She is a young
girl who lives a few miles away in a magnificent house
called Deane Castle. She is as beautiful as a dream,
and as heartless as she is beautiful. She has a doll-like
pink-and-white face, big blue eyes, and a wealth of
flaxen curls. Though she looks like an angel, a bigger
devil in woman's form never lived.</p>

<p>"She was a great favorite with old Eugene Mallard,
the uncle, and his fond wish was that his favorite
nephew should fall in love with and marry the pretty
girl. But, bless you, the young man had ideas of his
own."</p>

<p>"Who else is coming?" was the next question.</p>

<p>"A lady and her two daughters. They used to be
dead in love with Mr. Mallard, until they found it was
useless. They were more sensible, however, than Vivian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Deane. They turned their attention elsewhere, and
they are still looking for eligible husbands."</p>

<p>Ida May's heart throbbed wildly. Now she knew
why her husband's face had flushed as he mentioned
the name of Vivian Deane. And this was the young
girl whom she was so soon to meet!</p>

<p>Ida felt nervous at the very thought of the ordeal
before her. She knew she must be in the drawing-room
to welcome his guests. Her husband would expect that
of her.</p>

<p>Drying her tears, though her heart was heavy indeed,
the young wife stole back quietly to the house,
and up to her own room. When she had removed the
traces of tears, she looked with pitiful wistfulness at
the face which the mirror reflected.</p>

<p>How long would it take this Vivian Deane, who
loved her husband so madly, to discover that he was
most unhappy in his marriage?</p>

<p>There was a light tap on the door, and in answer to
her "Come in" one of the maids entered the room.</p>

<p>"If you please, Mrs. Mallard, your husband would
like to have you come down into the drawing-room. He
says the guests are likely to arrive at any moment."</p>

<p>"Say that I will be down directly," she replied, and
her voice sounded so hoarse and unnatural that she
feared the girl would notice her emotion.</p>

<p>"Would you like me to help you arrange your toilet,
ma'am?" she asked, still holding the door knob in her
hand.</p>

<p>Her toilet! she had not thought of it, so deeply had
she been engrossed in her thoughts. Yes, she must
make every effort to look well, because the eyes of her
rival would be upon her.</p>

<p>"Yes, you may help me if you will," she said, wistfully.
And when she was dressed and standing before
her mirror, she was so nervous she could hardly stand.
The maid noticed her trembling.</p>

<p>"You are ill, my lady," she cried, in alarm; "your
face has grown very pale. Do let me bring you a glass
of wine!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," replied her young mistress; "it is only a momentary
pain. I will be better presently."</p>

<p>As the maid watched, Ida's face grew from deathly
pale to a flushed appearance, and her hands were burning
hot.</p>

<p>"I think I must go and see the housekeeper. I am
sure Mrs. Mallard is not fit to receive guests. She is
very ill," she said to herself.</p>

<p>"If you only felt as well as you looked, my lady,"
said the girl, aloud and admiringly.</p>

<p>"Do you think I look well, Marie?" she asked, with
a pitiful eagerness in her voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, ma'am, if I dared speak the truth without being
accused of flattery, I would say I never saw any-one
so beautiful in all my life!"</p>

<p>"Do I look more beautiful than Vivian Deane?" was
the question that rose to her lips. But she checked the
words just in time. At that moment another maid
tapped at the door, and inquired if her mistress would
soon be down.</p>

<p>"Yes," returned Ida. "I am coming directly."</p>

<p>As she uttered the words, she heard the sound of carriage
wheels. By a great effort, she nerved herself for
the ordeal.</p>

<p>"Why, how foolish I am!" she said, with a nervous
little laugh. But somehow a premonition of coming evil
crept over her which she could not shake off.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.</a></h2>


<p>Eugene Mallard did not look up as his young wife
entered the room. He was gazing so steadily out of the
window that he did not even hear her light footsteps.
She went up to him timidly. Whatever she was about
to say died away on her lips, for the expression on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
face startled her. She had never seen him look so cross
before.</p>

<p>At that moment the servant announced: "Mrs. and
the Misses Staples!"</p>

<p>Eugene Mallard stepped forward quickly to receive
them. How his face lighted up! Was it only her fancy,
or did he hold the hand of the prettiest girl a moment
longer than was necessary? Then he turned and introduced
them to his young wife. Louisa and Dora Staples
looked at her eagerly; she could see great surprise in
their faces.</p>

<p>Were they disappointed in her? That was the first
thought that crossed Ida's mind. How was she to know
their thoughts? Dora Staples came forward, holding
out her hands and blushing like a school-girl. Louisa
stood back, gazing in puzzled wonder at the bride.</p>

<p>"We were very sorry that we could not be here to
witness your home-coming and to participate in the
grand wedding reception that every one is talking about
even yet. But we were miles and miles away."</p>

<p>Then the conversation drifted into other channels.</p>

<p>A few moments later two gentlemen arrived&mdash;Captain
Drury and Arthur Hollis. Ida remembered them well;
they had been to the reception. The two girls were
delighted at this acquisition to the party, and in a few
moments Dora Staples had captured the dashing captain
for a chat, leaving Arthur Hollis for her sister
Louisa.</p>

<p>But Mr. Hollis was not in a mood to enjoy the senseless
chatter of Miss Louisa Staples, for whom he inwardly
felt a cordial dislike.</p>

<p>On the pretense of wishing to smoke a cigar, especially
as her mother and Mrs. Mallard had joined the
group, he begged her to excuse him for a little while.
He saw his host on the terrace, and stepped out of the
long French window, and went at once to where he
stood.</p>

<p>"I congratulate you upon the rare beauty of your
wife," he said, touching him familiarly upon the arm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
"I thought her exceedingly pretty the first time I saw
her; she has grown more beautiful since."</p>

<p>"I really ought to be obliged to you for the compliment,"
returned Eugene Mallard, laughingly.</p>

<p>"You ought to love her very much, for she is worth
loving," said Arthur Hollis, bluntly, as he knocked the
ashes from his cigar.</p>

<p>"Has any one told you that I do not?" asked Mallard,
quickly.</p>

<p>"No, certainly not; but she does not look happy,"
returned Hollis, thoughtfully. "As a friend of many
years' standing, I feel myself privileged to speak without
reserve to you, my old comrade. Forgive me for
saying that though your bride's eyes ought to be filled
with sunshine, they are noticeably sad and dreary.
Hers is not a happy face, Eugene."</p>

<p>Mr. Mallard frowned. He had heard quite enough
of this topic. His wife's face did not interest him.
Arthur Hollis had been his friend for long years; they
had been chums from childhood. Suddenly Eugene
turned and laid his hand on Arthur Hollis's shoulder.</p>

<p>"I have a strange explanation to make to you," he
said in a voice husky with emotion. "Your keen eyes
have discovered, Hollis, what I would fain have kept
from you. A full confession is good for the soul, they
say, and I will tell you this much, Arthur: the girl
whom I told you so much about, is not the one whom I
have married. At the altar, in a dimly lighted church,
this girl took the place of the one whom I was to wed,
and I did not find it out until we had been pronounced
man and wife."</p>

<p>Hollis could not have been more completely astounded
if a volcano had opened at his feet.</p>

<p>Eugene Mallard had to repeat his words before Hollis
could grasp the whole meaning of what he had heard.</p>

<p>"You must not think that I wronged her in any way,
that she had any claim upon me," went on Eugene Mallard,
huskily. "Do not judge me too hastily. It all
came about through a mistake. She&mdash;she&mdash;mistook me
for Royal Ainsley, my cousin, and hearing that I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
to be married, came there, and&mdash;and, by the aid of a
woman, succeeded in becoming my bride. And now,
because of it, three lives are ruined. I am trying to
make the best of it, but it seems, at times, as though
I will not be able to bear up under it&mdash;my whole heart
belonging to one woman, while I am wedded to
another."</p>

<p>"Great heavens!" exclaimed Hollis. "I did not
dream of such a state of affairs!"</p>

<p>"She is my wife in name only," added Eugene Mallard,
bitterly. "I do not know what the future will
bring forth. I can only say that I am trying to live
it out as best I can. My life is full of wretchedness,
and I can not see what will be the end of it all."</p>

<p>Now Arthur Hollis could readily understand the
brooding look in Ida's eyes. Why she was graver, more
thoughtful, more abstracted than when he had seen her
last.</p>

<p>While they were talking, another carriage drove up.</p>

<p>They saw a beautiful face at the window.</p>

<p>"It is Vivian Deane," said Mr. Mallard.</p>

<p>Hollis looked surprised.</p>

<p>"I hope, my dear boy," he said in a tone of jest,
beneath which was certainly a vein of earnestness,
"that Miss Deane has got over her mad infatuation for
you, now that she knows you are married!"</p>

<p>Mr. Mallard looked thoughtful.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are wondering why I invited her
here," he said, slowly, "and I may as well tell you the
truth, that you will not for a moment imagine I sent
for her to indulge in a flirtation. Miss Deane wrote
me that she was coming to pay my wife a fortnight's
visit, so what could I do. Without waiting to receive
a reply from me, here she is. You will come with me,
and welcome her?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Hollis, understanding Eugene's
position.</p>

<p>Miss Deane looked exceedingly annoyed as the two
men approached.</p>

<p>She had calculated upon meeting Eugene alone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
She meant to tell him in a few words that her life was
ruined because of his marriage. Now she could only exchange
the merest formal greeting. Biting her red lips
fiercely, and forcing a smile to them, she held out her
hand.</p>

<p>"I am so delighted at seeing you again, Mr. Mallard,"
she declared, giving Hollis a stiff, haughty
bow.</p>

<p>Eugene assisted her from the carriage and avoided
looking at her as much as possible&mdash;a fact which annoyed
her exceedingly.</p>

<p>"And I am so anxious to see your bride," she continued.</p>

<p>Eugene could readily understand that, and so could
Hollis.</p>

<p>Hollis followed his friend to the drawing-room. He
stood by the young bride's side when Vivian Deane was
presented to her.</p>

<p>He had expected to see an expression of bitter dislike
on the doll-like pink-and-white face. He was surprised
and relieved to see Vivian hold out her little hands and
murmur in her cooing voice:</p>

<p>"I am so delighted to see you, Mrs. Mallard, I am
sure we shall be friends."</p>

<p>Ida gazed anxiously, wistfully, into the pink-and-white
face. Vivian's sea-blue eyes met her gaze unflinchingly;
her red lips, which suggested more of art
than nature, wore a mask of the sweetest smiles.</p>

<p>The young bride drew a deep breath of relief. She
had been unnecessarily frightened, she told herself.
Now that Vivian knew Eugene was married, she had
in all probability resigned herself to the inevitable.</p>

<p>"Probably she has another lover by this time, and
thinks no more of Eugene," thought Ida.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.</a></h2>


<p>Alone in her room, Vivian Deane stood before her
mirror and critically viewed the face reflected in it.</p>

<p>"I am more beautiful than Eugene Mallard's wife,"
she cried, nodding approvingly to the dimpled, smiling
face, "and I will make that beauty tell. He does not
look happy," she mused. "I, who know him so well,
can see it. He has married her, but he is dissatisfied.
There is something amiss between them. Ere I have
been in this house a week, I will discover what it is."
She nodded to the reflection in the mirror. "I had
hoped that, seeing him married, I could steel my heart
against him, but I find I can not."</p>

<p>"There is something connected with the manner in
which Eugene Mallard first met his wife that I must find
out," was Vivian's mental comment.</p>

<p>It was not long before Vivian discovered that her
beautiful young hostess knew almost nothing of music.</p>

<p>"I think I have discovered her secret," she said to
herself. "She must have been a poor girl, perhaps a
working-girl."</p>

<p>Instead of seeing the wisdom of God in such an alliance,
whereby the wealthy might share with the poor
the gifts God had showered upon them, she was angrier
than ever.</p>

<p>From the hour in which she had asked Ida the question
concerning her meeting with Eugene Mallard, the
young wife avoided being alone with her guest.</p>

<p>Vivian could not help but notice it, and she smiled to
herself. She seemed to have no wish to capture handsome
Captain Drury or Arthur Hollis. She preferred to
talk to her hostess on each and every occasion.</p>

<p>"Yon have not told me," she said one day, "whether
you lived in New York, San Francisco or Boston."</p>

<p>"Most of my life was spent in a little village outside
of the great metropolis," said Ida, inwardly hoping the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
inquisitive girl would not think of asking the name of
the village.</p>

<p>Vivian did think of it, but concluded that it would
be wisest not to pursue her inquiries too ardently.</p>

<p>"All this ought to have been mine," muttered Vivian,
clinching her hands tightly&mdash;"all mine! I loved him
first, and I loved him best. She had no right to take him
from me!"</p>

<p>These thoughts often ran through Vivian's mind
while Ida was talking to her, believing she was entertaining
the best and truest friend she had in the great
cruel world.</p>

<p>If the young wife had known her as she really was,
she would have turned in utter loathing from the beautiful
pink-and-white face; she would have prayed
Heaven to save her from this, her greatest foe.</p>

<p>As it was, she saw only Vivian Deane's beauty and
grace. She heard only kindness in her voice, and she
thought to herself that she was very fortunate indeed in
securing such a friend.</p>

<p>She talked and laughed so happily that the poor
young wife almost forgot her sorrow while listening
to her.</p>

<p>Vivian wondered if by any chance the young bride
had found out how desperately she had been in love with
her husband in other days.</p>

<p>The young wife became more and more unhappy day
by day. Once, in following the windings of a brook,
Ida was startled at finding herself several miles from
home. Glancing up with a start, she found that the
sun had almost reached its height. She had been gone
longer than she had intended.</p>

<p>Perhaps there was some way by which she could take
a shorter cut to the house. She saw a woman slowly
advancing along the path, carrying a little baby in her
arms. She stopped short as the woman approached.
She recognized her as the wife of one of the village
merchants.</p>

<p>Ida had often seen her driving on the road with her
husband, holding the little child in her lap, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
had said to herself, as she turned away to hide the
tears that would spring to her eyes: "That woman has
everything in the world to make her life happy. I
would exchange places with her gladly if I could."</p>

<p>The woman smiled as she saw Eugene Mallard's
young wife, and appeared annoyed upon observing
that she was about to stop and speak to her. She answered
her question readily enough, and pointed out
the way, a short cut over the meadows, that would bring
her near her home. Still Ida lingered, looking wistfully
at the young mother.</p>

<p>"I have often seen you, from my window, rambling
by the brook-side. You must be very fond of out-door
life," said Ida.</p>

<p>"I do love the sunshine," replied the young woman;
"but I do not come out for it only for myself, but for
baby's sake also."</p>

<p>A great, sudden thrill that made her soul grow faint
and dizzy filled Ida's whole being as her gaze rested on
the babe she carried. She thought of that other one,
in a nameless grave, sleeping under the daisies. It
would have been just about the age of this little one
had it lived.</p>

<p>"How happy you must be!" sighed Ida.</p>

<p>"We are not always what we seem," replied the woman,
with a sigh. "I love this little thing very dearly,
but it is not my own child. I had a little one whom I
loved better than my life," went on the woman, sadly.
"When it died, I refused to be comforted. I took on
so that my husband grew frightened.</p>

<p>"'Don't fret, Margaret,' he said; 'I will find a way
to comfort you.'</p>

<p>"He sent to some foundling asylum in the great city,
and this little one was brought to me to fill the aching
void in my heart. I love it very dearly, but oh! it can
never take the place of the one I lost."</p>

<p>Eugene Mallard's wife was looking at it with her
soul in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Poor little waif!" she sighed; "it was very fortunate
in securing a home with you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Mallard," said the woman. "We
are poor and plain people, but we will do what we can
for the poor little thing."</p>

<p>She was about to pass on, thinking she had taken up
too much of the lady's time with her story.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ida turned, her beautiful dark eyes heavy
with tears.</p>

<p>"Would you mind letting me hold the baby for just
one minute?" she asked, wistfully.</p>

<p>"No, certainly not," replied the woman, with a pleasant
smile.</p>

<p>Again that thrill which she could hardly define shot
through her as she received the babe from the woman's
arms. She bent her face over the little rose-leaf one
that lay upon her breast. Her lips moved, but no sound
came from them.</p>

<p>It seemed to rend her very heart-strings to relinquish
her hold of the infant&mdash;to hand it back to the woman
who waited to receive it. The moments seemed to fly
by on golden wings.</p>

<p>It seemed to Ida that she could stand there for long
hours looking down into that lovely little face and those
two great starry eyes that looked up wonderingly into
her own. It cost her a great pang to hand the child
back to the woman. But time was fleeting. She could
not remain there longer, for the distant bells of the village
were already ringing, proclaiming the noonday
hour, and she must go home, or luncheon would be kept
waiting.</p>

<p>"You come here often?" she asked, turning again to
the woman.</p>

<p>"Almost every day," was the reply.</p>

<p>The hapless young wife made up her mind that she
would see them often. Acting upon a sudden impulse,
she took out her purse and handed the woman a golden
coin.</p>

<p>"Take that for the little one," she said. "What is its
name?"</p>

<p>"We haven't decided upon its name yet," returned
the woman; "we have only had the child a few weeks."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"Would you think over it if I suggested a name?"
asked Ida, wistfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," replied the woman. "You may be
sure I would."</p>

<p>"Why not call her 'Ida May'?" murmured the young
wife, with her whole heart and soul in her eyes.</p>

<p>"That is a beautiful name," cried the woman&mdash;"Ida
May Lester. That is what it shall be!"</p>

<p>Somehow the naming of the poor waif gave to the
hapless young wife a great relief.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.</a></h2>


<p>Ida wended her way over the flower-strewn meadow,
with her heart beating more wildly than it had ever
beaten before. She could not forget the flower-like
little infant that had looked up into her face, and
which had so strangely affected her.</p>

<p>Even the guests noted her heightened color; and
Vivian Deane, watching her narrowly from across the
table, wondered what brought the brightness to her
eyes.</p>

<p>She looked at Eugene Mallard with intense interest.
Surely there was no corresponding gladness in his
eyes. Indeed, he looked unusually careworn.</p>

<p>"I will soon find out what has happened," said
Vivian, with a pang of bitter jealousy.</p>

<p>A little later Vivian sought Ida in her <i>boudoir</i>.</p>

<p>"It has commenced to rain," she said, "and I am
at a loss to know what to do with myself. The Staples
girls have gone to their rooms to rest, and their mother
wearies me talking about Christian charity. The gentlemen
have repaired to the smoking-room, and so I
have sought you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are very welcome," said Ida. "I will do my
best to amuse you."</p>

<p>As she looked at Vivian, she said to herself:</p>

<p>"How foolish I have been to imagine that this
brilliant, beautiful girl should care for a man who
belonged to another girl."</p>

<p>Vivian had a very fascinating way when among
women, and now she exerted herself to please Eugene
Mallard's young wife as she had never exerted herself
to please any one before.</p>

<p>"What a very cozy <i>boudoir</i> you have, Ida!" she said.
"It is like a casket for some precious jewel. How
considerate your husband was to have it furnished to
suit your rich dark beauty. I used to think that nothing
was pretty except white and gold or blue and white."</p>

<p>"That is only natural," returned Ida. "You are a
pronounced blonde, you know."</p>

<p>"Then you do not agree with me that there is a possibility
of blondes liking rich dark surroundings?"</p>

<p>"No; I should not fancy so," returned Ida, "except
that blondes usually fall in love with dark men."</p>

<p>Vivian flushed a vivid scarlet, which Ida did not see,
for at that moment Vivian's face was turned from her.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is very true," returned Vivian, making
an effort to control her emotion.</p>

<p>In her case, Vivian knew that the old saying was at
fault. The strong, passionate love of her heart had
gone out to Eugene Mallard, and he was fair. He was
her ideal of manly beauty. The faces of other men appeared
quite insignificant when compared to his. She
was anxious to turn the conversation into another channel.</p>

<p>"I have often thought, amid all this gayety, how
lonely you must be at times without some girl friend
to talk matters over with you," said Vivian.</p>

<p>"You are quite right," said Ida, eagerly. "I <i>do</i> need
a girl friend, some one of my own age, to whom I could
open my heart."</p>

<p>Vivian glided up to her and threw her arms about her
neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me be that friend," she whispered, eagerly.</p>

<p>The young wife looked at her wistfully; her cheeks
flushed.</p>

<p>"I shall be only too glad, Vivian," Ida said.</p>

<p>"If she had heard that I was in love with her husband,
I must first throw her off the track," thought
Vivian.</p>

<p>"I am going to tell you a secret," she murmured,
aloud; "but you must not reveal it to any one, I have
had a strange love affair, Ida."</p>

<p>She felt the young wife start, her figure tremble; she
saw the lovely face grow pale. But not appearing to
notice her agitation, she went on:</p>

<p>"My hero is as dark as a Spanish knight. I met him
recently. It was a case of love at first sight. He proposed
to me within a fortnight. But my relatives do
not like him, wealthy, handsome, courteous though he
is. They have forbidden him the house, yet I think in
time they will overcome their objections."</p>

<p>She could plainly see how her fictitious story relieved
the young wife. The color came back to Ida's cheeks,
the light to her eyes. She threw her arms impulsively
about Vivian, and kissed her fair, lovely, treacherous
face.</p>

<p>"You are indeed to be envied, Vivian," she said,
earnestly. "To love and be loved is the greatest happiness
God can give any one. I hope, for <i>your</i> sake, that
your lover may win his way to the hearts of your relatives.
But you know that the course of true love never
did run smoothly."</p>

<p>"My lover is a great friend of your husband's, and
perhaps he has told you about it?"</p>

<p>"No," said Ida. "I assure you that Mr. Mallard has
not spoken to me on the subject," and she looked very
discomforted.</p>

<p>"I am sure your husband must have received a letter
from my lover and hidden it away somewhere. Won't
you be so kind as to look thoroughly through his desk,
and see?" asked Vivian.</p>

<p>Ida drew back in alarm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I could do not do what you ask. Mr. Mallard's
rooms are in another part of the house," Ida answered,
thoughtlessly.</p>

<p>Ida now realized the importance of the admission
she had thoughtlessly made. But she could not recall her
words&mdash;it was too late.</p>

<p>Vivian looked astounded. This was a state of affairs
of which she had never dreamed. Her idea had been
to find some pretext to look through Eugene Mallard's
desk, and to abstract all the notes she had written to
him.</p>

<p>She remembered one or two which she had written in
which she had poured out her love for him in a mad
fashion, and she would not like any one to come across
them.</p>

<p>But here she had unearthed a startling surprise. Eugene
Mallard's rooms were in another part of the house.
Then they were indeed estranged. She must find out
the secret that lay between them.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry to have unearthed so sad a secret,"
cried the false friend, winding her arms more tightly
about Ida, and turning her face away, that the young
wife might not observe the look of triumph in it. "But
every life has its sorrow, and perhaps it was meant that
I should comfort you. If you are wearing out your
heart longing for the sympathy of a true friend, oh,
dear Ida, please do confide in me, and let me help
you!"</p>

<p>The words had such a ring of sympathy in them
that it was no wonder the young wife believed her.
She was young and unversed in the ways of the world,
or this beautiful false friend could not have deceived
her so.</p>

<p>"Oh, Vivian, I <i>am</i> unhappy," she sobbed, "surely
the most unhappy girl the sun ever shone on! I must
make a confidant of some one&mdash;tell some one my
troubles, or I shall die. My&mdash;my husband does not
love me!"</p>

<p>"Does not love you!" repeated Vivian. "Then why
on earth did he marry you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>The hapless young wife could find no answer to that
question; her head drooped, and her lips were dumb.</p>

<p>"I am so glad you told me this," said Vivian; and
it was strange that Ida did not notice the ring of
triumph in the voice of her false friend as she said: "I
will do my best to bring you two together. I do not
ask which one is at fault. Both can not be entirely
blameless."</p>

<p>"There is a shadow between us which never can be
lifted," sobbed the young wife, putting her head on
Vivian's shoulder. "There is love on only one side,"
went on Ida, despairingly. "He is indifferent to me,
and&mdash;and he will grow to hate me."</p>

<p>"Forgive me, please, if I have been so engrossed in
my own love affair that I did not notice anything was
amiss between my old friend Eugene and his fair young
bride."</p>

<p>"I almost dread to think of the future," moaned the
young wife. "There are times when I give myself up
to wondering over the strange problems of life, and I
ask myself why I, who should be happy, find the world
so dark and dreary."</p>

<p>"You must be very patient," said Vivian, "and above
all things, let me warn you against being the first to
make overtures for a reconciliation."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so very, very glad that I have had this
talk with you," sobbed Ida, "for during the past week
I had come to the conclusion that the very first time I
found my husband in the library, I would go up to him,
and say; 'This kind of life is killing me. It would be
better far for you to plunge a knife in my breast and
kill me. Either take me to your heart, either make me
your wife in fact as well as name, or send me out into
the coldness and bitterness of the world. I can endure
this no longer. Your friends crowd about me, thinking
I am the happiest person in the world, while I am the
most miserable. I must go from here, because I have
learned to love you, my husband, with all my heart and
soul. You may be surprised to hear this from me, but
it is the truth. I love you as no one else ever will.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
You may live for years, flattered and happy, but no
love like mine will ever come to you again. Although
you married me, yet you do not love me, and never will.
Always remember that the wife who is leaving you
loves you with all her heart. I would not tell you this
now, but that I know in this world we may never meet
again.'"</p>

<p>Her voice died away in a whisper as she uttered the
last word, and the false friend who had determined to
part husband and wife said she had learned just in time
what was necessary to prevent a reconciliation between
Ida and her husband.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII.</a></h2>


<p>After Vivian Deane had learned of the estrangement
of Eugene and Ida, she made up her mind that
she would part them forever.</p>

<p>But how? She thought over the matter long and
earnestly. She was standing in the magnificent drawing-room
one morning, when Arthur Hollis entered.</p>

<p>"How does it happen that you are not out for a
canter on horseback with our host and Captain
Drury?" she asked. "This is such a delightful morning."</p>

<p>"Ah, Miss Deane," he replied, laughingly, showing
a handsome set of white teeth, "I was just bemoaning
that fact. But I had some important letters to write,
and I was obliged to remain in my room and finish
them."</p>

<p>At that moment they saw their young hostess crossing
the lawn. Vivian saw Arthur Hollis look after her
with a long, steady, earnest gaze, until she was quite
out of their sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you admiring our young hostess?" she asked,
suddenly, with something like a frown on her face.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, frankly. "I was just thinking
that Mrs. Mallard has the sweetest face and most
charming manner of any woman I ever met."</p>

<p>"Then you admire her style of beauty?" said Vivian,
a little piqued.</p>

<p>"Yes, very much," said Arthur Hollis. "If I had
met her before she married our friend Eugene, I think
I should have fallen in love with her myself."</p>

<p>The words were innocent enough; but Arthur Hollis
never for a moment dreamed of the terrible mischief
they were to do in the after years.</p>

<p>Those words so simply uttered sent a thrill through
the heart of the girl who listened.</p>

<p>"Ah, I have it!" she said to herself. "A way is
opened to me at last to part Eugene Mallard and his
wife. I will encourage Arthur Hollis's admiration for
the beautiful Ida. Men are easily flattered. There is
no knowing what the end will be."</p>

<p>It was a plot worthy of a fiend incarnate; but this
girl, who loved Eugene Mallard, would stop at nothing
to gain her end.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII.</a></h2>


<p>During the fortnight that followed, Arthur Hollis
sunned himself each day more and more in Ida's presence.</p>

<p>No one noticed it save Vivian Deane. He saw no
danger, nor did she, in their companionship. In the
meantime, the shadow darkened and deepened. It was
simply the old story in another form.</p>

<p>They were both young. She was gifted with the
sweetest grace that ever a woman possessed; he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
brave, courteous, and noble, with the first throb of a
mighty passion in his heart.</p>

<p>What usually happens in such cases? He fell desperately
in love with Ida.</p>

<p>At first Arthur told himself it was pity for her loneliness
that actuated him to be always at her side, to
make time pass pleasantly for her. He realized, when
it was too late, that pity had deepened into a mighty
love. And he told himself, in his despair, as the truth
forced itself upon him, that he loved her.</p>

<p>The truth came to him like a great shock. He went
to Eugene Mallard, and told him he must go away at
once. It would have been better if he had told him
why; but he did not.</p>

<p>"I will not listen to such a thing!" cried Eugene.
"You have promised to stay until the shooting season,
and I will hold you to your word."</p>

<p>In vain he pleaded. But Eugene was obdurate.</p>

<p>"There is no good reason for your hurrying away,"
said Eugene.</p>

<p>"Then you want me to stay, no matter what happens?"
replied his friend, quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Eugene Mallard; and he thought of
Arthur's words for many a day afterward.</p>

<p>Arthur Hollis tried to reason with himself, saying
that it was better to go. But he was like the moth, who
felt insensibly attracted toward the flame, drawing
nearer and nearer, until, like the moth, he would perish
in it.</p>

<p>After his conversation with Eugene, he proceeded to
shut his eyes to the danger.</p>

<p>He was a free-lance. No woman's face had ever
touched his heart before, and he was frightened at the
intensity of the love that thrilled his heart for beautiful
Ida Mallard.</p>

<p>He would sun himself in her presence for one brief
fortnight longer, and then go away. Surely it was not
much in a life-time. He would not deprive himself of
the one glimpse of sunshine that had drifted into his
life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Every day found them together.</p>

<p>Although Ida did not realize what was in his heart,
yet she felt intuitively that there was a great change
in Arthur Hollis since he had been beneath that roof.</p>

<p>Although he lingered with his feet on the edge of a
precipice, yet he stood face to face with the truth&mdash;he
loved at last with all the passionate strength of his
heart and nature.</p>

<p>He said to himself that if marriages were made in
heaven, she was the one woman intended for him; she
was the only woman in this world that he could ever
love.</p>

<p>If she had only been free, he would have given her
his life, his love&mdash;all that he had on earth to give.</p>

<p>To make the situation all the more pitiful, he knew
that she was a wife in name only to the man whose name
she bore; that she was as far removed from him as
though she dwelt in an opposite part of the world from
him.</p>

<p>She was so young, so unhappy, he pitied her with all
his heart. He was perplexed, agitated.</p>

<p>How he enjoyed the rambles, the rides with her! The
sweetest moment of his life was when he could steal
upon her unawares.</p>

<p>He saw no danger, and in the meantime the shadow
darkened and deepened. Vivian Deane watched them
with exultant eyes.</p>

<p>"It will end in an elopement," she told herself,
triumphantly. "Their hearts are drifting nearer and
nearer together, and the end is not far off."</p>

<p>Every day seemed to make Ida more cold and careless,
and to leave an added sternness upon the face of
Eugene Mallard, and a harshness in his voice.</p>

<p>His marriage had been a bitter regret. It was an
effort now to even keep up appearances. He had sealed
his misery. There were times when he wished fiercely,
miserably, that he could sever that most unhappy bond
and set her free.</p>

<p>Not all the wealth and luxury and the army of obsequious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
servants could make the grand old mansion a
home in its true sense.</p>

<p>The young wife plunged into a ceaseless round of
frivolity with a reckless <i>abandon</i> quite foreign to her
nature.</p>

<p>She accepted every invitation that came to her, and
gave in return a series of entertainments of so extravagant
and magnificent a character that the people around
opened their eyes in astonishment, and whispered it was
well that Eugene Mallard's pocket was a deep one.</p>

<p>But before long they found something else to comment
upon. Wherever Ida went, whether she went
abroad or entertained at home, at dinner, ball, assembly,
there, always closely in her train, might be seen
the handsome Arthur Hollis.</p>

<p>Gossip began to circulate, slight and vague at first,
but it soon became plainly hinted that Eugene Mallard's
beautiful young wife was flirting with Arthur
Hollis&mdash;flirting defiantly, desperately, recklessly.
People wondered in indignant astonishment if her husband
was blind or mad.</p>

<p>Almost everybody was discussing the piquant scandal.
Even those who had been her guests found something
to say, declaring that they had noticed it from
the first, adding this or that detail as the occasion
prompted.</p>

<p>They wondered why some one did not drop a hint
to the husband. Unsuspicious by nature, and disregarding
the formal calls of society whenever he could
possibly do so, he very seldom accompanied his wife
on the rounds of gayety on which she had embarked.
For weeks neither significant words nor glances came
to him.</p>

<p>But he did hear of it at last, and then the blow struck
him with terrible effect. It was only a few sentences
spoken by a couple of ladies, and pointed with a venom
which only a woman's tongue can give, coupling the
name of his wife with that of Arthur Hollis.</p>

<p>But the import of their words was unmistakable, and
the shock seemed momentarily to stop the young man's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
breath. The two scandal-mongers lingered over their
gossip with keen delight, not knowing that they were
overheard. It was at a garden-party given by Ida.
Eugene Mallard had gone into the grounds to enjoy a
cigar in a favorite little retreat which few of the guests
had as yet discovered. He did not care for the dancing
on the lawn, and could not be induced to join the dancers.</p>

<p>Hidden by a group of laurel-bushes, Eugene's quick
ear caught the words of two young girls walking slowly
down the path.</p>

<p>"Have you seen our hostess, young Mrs. Mallard?"
asked one of the other. "I have been searching for her
everywhere."</p>

<p>"Look for handsome Arthur Hollis," returned her
companion. "You will surely find her with him."</p>

<p>The rest of the sentence was uttered in a whisper, but
Eugene Mallard heard every word of it.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX.</a></h2>


<p>Eugene Mallard flung down the cigar which he had
just lighted as soon as the girls passed, and made his
way from the place.</p>

<p>He resisted the impulse to turn fiercely upon them
and demand how they dared to speak of his young wife
in that manner. It required all his strength of will to
keep down his anger.</p>

<p>He passed the two girls on the path a moment later,
and though they gave a start, they believed that he had
not heard their remarks, for he did not betray his anger
in his face.</p>

<p>Eugene looked about for his wife. His eyes wandered
sharply around as he threaded his way among the
dancers. But Ida was not visible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Crossing the lawn, he encountered Vivian Deane and
Captain Drury. She was looking her sweetest in pale-blue
summer silk half veiled by white lace and pink
rosebuds.</p>

<p>He would have passed them by, with a few forced
words of pleasantry, but Vivian would not have it so.</p>

<p>"You have not danced once this afternoon, Eugene,"
she said; "and a host who does his duty should figure in
some of the waltzes at least. Are you looking for a
partner now? Shall I find you one?"</p>

<p>"No; thanks, Vivian," he answered. "I am looking
for my&mdash;my wife. Do you know where she is?"</p>

<p>"Yes," returned Vivian. "I saw her a moment ago.
Let me see where it was. Oh, yes; I remember&mdash;down
by the clump of oaks. She and Mr. Hollis had danced
four consecutive dances together, and were resting. By
the way," she added, with a gay little laugh, and something
like a pout on her pretty red lips, "you must tell
her not to monopolize Mr. Hollis, Eugene. It is too bad
of her. It does not give a <i>single</i> girl a fair chance, you
know."</p>

<p>Vivian moved away with the captain after giving him
that parting shot, and Eugene was not rendered much
easier by her last words, although they were apparently
gayly and carelessly spoken.</p>

<p>He walked hurriedly to the further end of the
grounds, and there, under a huge oak-tree, he caught
a glimpse of a filmy white dress.</p>

<p>Advancing, he saw his wife sitting there, with Arthur
Hollis beside her.</p>

<p>Neither saw him. Ida's eyes were fixed upon a crimson
rose she was recklessly plucking to pieces. She
seemed to be hardly heeding her companion's words.</p>

<p>Arthur was leaning back against the oak-tree, looking
down at the dark, curly head, and he was speaking
earnestly in a tone hardly above a whisper.</p>

<p>A handsome couple they looked, and surely like
nothing so much as lovers.</p>

<p>Eugene realized this, and a feeling of wrath took
possession of him. He did not love her; in fact, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
were times when he told himself that he hated her with
the bitterest kind of hatred; but she bore his name,
and she must not be allowed to set the tongues of
gossipers wagging.</p>

<p>Eugene knew that she did not mean anything by
receiving the attentions of handsome Arthur Hollis,
his friend. She was but a young girl, after all, and she
thoughtlessly allowed herself to drift into this most
wretched flirtation.</p>

<p>His thoughts went no deeper, no further than that;
but that was far enough, and for the sake of her good
name, this thoughtless, reckless nonsense must be
stopped. He trusted her implicitly, yet he felt a mad,
unreasonable rage against the two sitting there.</p>

<p>It was well his will was so strong and his temper so
well under control, or he could not have advanced as
calmly as he did.</p>

<p>Ida was dressed in white. It struck him that she
looked very beautiful. But just then her beauty seemed
to exasperate and harden her husband toward her.</p>

<p>Ida glanced up, and seeing him, started.</p>

<p>Arthur Hollis appeared a little uncomfortable, but
after the first sharp glance, Eugene Mallard did not
look at him, feeling that he could not trust himself to
do so. He addressed his wife, looking at her with a
dark frown on his face.</p>

<p>"Vivian told me you were here," he began. "Are
you going to dance the next set?"</p>

<p>Her face flushed, her hands trembled. Was <i>he</i>, her
husband, coming to ask her to dance with him? His
next words showed her how mad she had been to
cherish such a hope.</p>

<p>"I was going to ask Vivian to dance," he said. "I
see there are three couples standing over there ready
to dance. It will require one more couple to fill up the
set."</p>

<p>With something like haughty pride, she raised her
dark head.</p>

<p>"I shall not dance," said Ida, in a cold, bitter voice.
"I am tired."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Arthur Hollis had the grace to laughingly excuse
himself. He had been enjoying his <i>tte--tte</i>, and the
sudden appearance of her husband on the scene was not
welcome. Besides, he had noticed that there was something
in Eugene Mallard's face which he did not like.</p>

<p>Arthur Hollis did not speak, and Eugene Mallard
waited until he was well out of hearing. The silence
lasted so long that Ida broke it by petulantly saying:</p>

<p>"As I shall not dance this set, would it not be as well
for you to find some one else? The music is just starting."</p>

<p>He did not appear to listen to the remark. His eyes
were riveted on the little satin programme, suspended
by a little silver cord at her belt, and he saw the initials
of Arthur Hollis written opposite six or eight dances.</p>

<p>His face grew hard, stern, and rigid. Had he been
blind not to have noticed what was going on, when it
was so plainly apparent to every one else?</p>

<p>"I should like to ask something of you," he said,
pointing to the card. "I want you to promise me that
you will not dance any more with Arthur Hollis."</p>

<p>With a feeling of mingled rage and pain he saw that
Ida turned first pale then scarlet. She drew herself up
to her full height and looked at him with a <i>hauteur</i>
which she never knew she possessed.</p>

<p>"May I ask why you make such a request?" she
asked, sharply.</p>

<p>"For to-day let it be enough that I make the request.
Will you promise me?"</p>

<p>All the spirit that Ida possessed was up in arms.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," Ida responded. "I would not
dream of breaking an engagement for no reason whatever."</p>

<p>There was a pause, filled only by the strains of distant
music.</p>

<p>Paler than usual and with a stern look overspreading
his face, Eugene Mallard waited for his wife to continue,
as she seemed to have something more to say.</p>

<p>"If you objected to your friend dancing with me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
you&mdash;you should have made the request before the engagements
were made."</p>

<p>He looked at her angrily, his fair, handsome face
flushing.</p>

<p>"A half dozen engagements should not have been
made," he returned. "People will certainly comment
upon it. They are already whispering of my friend's
attention to you."</p>

<p>A strange look which he could not analyze crossed
the beautiful face.</p>

<p>"You must stop this gossip," he went on, "or I will
take measures to do so. I have made a request of you,
and shown you why I made it. Will you grant it&mdash;for
your own sake?"</p>

<p>"I refuse!" she repeated. "I am sorry that you do
not think me capable of protecting my own name&mdash;and
yours."</p>

<p>With something like a muttered imprecation on his
lips, he turned on his heel, and strode rapidly from her
side.</p>

<p>"Fool that I was!" he muttered, clinching his hands
together. "To save her honor I married her. But
what does she care for my honor?"</p>

<p>The breech between them grew wider than ever now.</p>

<p>Ida danced with Arthur Hollis, and the tongues of
the gossips wagged. If Eugene Mallard heard, he paid
no heed. Strange thoughts were passing through his
mind.</p>

<p>All unmindful of what Eugene Mallard had to say
to his wife, Arthur Hollis danced with her, and hovered
more closely than ever by her side.</p>

<p>He was growing desperate. His stay was drawing
to a close. He meant to make the most of the few hours
of sunshine and happiness before he turned his back
on all that made life worth the living.</p>

<p>At the finish of one of the dances a messenger-boy
was seen approaching with a telegram.</p>

<p>"For Mr. Arthur Hollis," he called.</p>

<p>Mechanically Arthur held out his hand. It was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
dispatch requiring his immediate presence in Baltimore
to attend to some urgent business.</p>

<p>"Have you bad news?" asked Ida, turning to him;
for she saw his face had grown very pale.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;no," he answered, incoherently, a troubled
look coming into his eyes. "I must go away." He did
not look at her as he uttered the words. "I must go
within the hour," he said, huskily. "Come down by
the brook where we have passed so many happy hours.
I should like to say good-bye to you there."</p>

<p>For a moment she hesitated; then seeing the sorrowful
look on his face, she quietly allowed him to lead her
down the path toward the brook.</p>

<p>In silence they walked through the sunshine, heedless
that there were two pairs of eyes following them&mdash;Vivian
Deane's from one part of the grounds, and
Eugene Mallard's from another.</p>

<p>Vivian turned and followed them. That was the beginning
of the tragedy that darkened three lives.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XL" id="CHAPTER_XL">CHAPTER XL.</a></h2>


<p>Slowly Ida and Arthur Hollis walked together over
the beautiful green lawn, Vivian Deane creeping like
the shadow of fate after them.</p>

<p>Arthur seated Ida in her favorite nook on the mossy
stone. For a moment neither of them spoke; then he
suddenly caught her little hand in his. Ida did not
know why she trembled, why her hand grew cold in
his clasp.</p>

<p>There was not a cloud in the blue sky overhead.
The cool, sweet breeze shook the rose leaves and scattered
them on the grass; the leaves of the oak-trees
stirred on the great boughs. A calm, sweet and solemn
in its beauty, stole over them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ida," he whispered, hoarsely, "did ever a great
pity fill your heart for any one? If so, let pity fill it
now for me, for I am in need of it."</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked, looking wonderingly up at him.</p>

<p>"How I shall look back to this hour when I am
gone!" he said, brokenly.</p>

<p>"When I am gone!" The words had a sad murmur
in them, like the fall of autumn leaves. They pierced
the very heart of the girl who heard them.</p>

<p>"When you are gone?" she repeated. "What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"I am going away within the hour," he said. "The
telegram I received calls me back to Baltimore by the
first train," he added.</p>

<p>Involuntarily Ida drew closer to him, her face paling.
Suddenly the light went out of the sun, the glory
faded from the blue sky; the music of the birds was
hushed, the bitterness of death seemed to have fallen
over her heart.</p>

<p>"Going away?" She repeated the words over and
over again, but she could not realize their meaning.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I have been so happy, I forgot you would have
to go away," she said, slowly.</p>

<p>"I am going down to Central America. I may die
of fever and never come back," he answered, with passionate
pain in his voice. "If I am spared to return,
it may not be for years. I will have passed out of
your thoughts by that time. You will have forgotten
the pleasant hours we spent together, forgotten our
rambles through the sunny hours. You will have grown
into a woman of the world by that time. You have not
begun life yet."</p>

<p>"I feel as though I had finished with it," she murmured.</p>

<p>She did not try to check the words that came throbbing
to her lips.</p>

<p>"I wish you had not come into my life only to go out
of it," she added, with passionate pain.</p>

<p>He looked at her, and strong man though he was, his
lips trembled. She had raised her face to his, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
looked so beautiful, so unhappy, that he turned away
with a groan which came from the very depths of his
heart.</p>

<p>Vivian Deane had crept near enough to hear the first
words that had passed between them. She knew that
he had received a telegram calling him away. He had
either taken Ida Mallard down to the brook-side to say
good-bye, or to urge her to elope with him. Most likely
the latter.</p>

<p>She would go and fetch Eugene. He should be a
silent witness to the scene; then her vengeance would
be complete.</p>

<p>She knew his pride, his temper. She knew he would
not raise his voice to utter one word to stay her steps.
He would spurn her, he would force her to go.</p>

<p>Vivian hurried back to the dancers on the lawn. Eugene
Mallard was standing apart from his guests. She
glided up to him and laid a little white hand upon his
arm.</p>

<p>"Eugene," she said, in a voice which trembled with
excitement, "I have always been your true friend. If
I saw you in danger, my first impulse would be to save
you. If I saw an enemy pointing a deadly arrow at
your heart, I would try to turn it aside. If I saw a dark
cloud hanging over you, my first impulse would be to
warn you."</p>

<p>"I anticipate what you are going to say, Vivian,"
he broke in, with an expression of annoyance on his
face. "You are going to repeat some gossip to me, and
I will say, before you begin, that I do not care to hear
it."</p>

<p>"If you will not heed the words of warning of one
who wishes you well, you must submit to the jeers of
the whole country. I advise you to go to the brook-side,
where your wife is saying farewell to Arthur
Hollis; or perhaps she is going with him."</p>

<p>She saw the look that passed over his face as she
turned swiftly and hurried away. He could not have
answered her if his life had depended upon it. Glancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
back over her shoulder, she saw that he had strolled
off in the direction which she had indicated.</p>

<p>"He will catch them making love to each other, and
then&mdash;Ah, well, we shall see!"</p>

<p>Ida and Arthur had walked in silence by the brook,
and they stood beside it for some moments without
speaking; then suddenly Arthur Hollis turned toward
her.</p>

<p>"Say that you will miss me when I am gone," he
murmured, with emotion.</p>

<p>"You know that I will," she answered. "But for
you, my life here would have been very lonely."</p>

<p>"Do you really mean that?" he asked, quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes," she returned, with something very like a
sob on her lips.</p>

<p>Impetuously he caught the little white hand that
hung by her side.</p>

<p>"Those words will linger in my memory until the
day I die!" he cried, huskily. "Ida, I am going away.
You will never see me in this world again. I shall
never come back."</p>

<p>She looked at him with her great dark eyes.</p>

<p>"It breaks my heart to say farewell," he continued,
huskily, "for when I leave you, Ida, I go out into the
darkness of death."</p>

<p>"Oh, do not say that!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Yes, the hour has come when I must tell you," he
answered. "It will ease my heart. Only forgive and
forget me. Oh, how am I to say good-bye to you?" he
asked, sharply, looking, with desperation in his eyes,
at the lovely pale face. "I have lived under the same
roof with you. I have been thrown into your society
day by day, yet I have kept my secret in my own heart.
Now I am going away, and I will tell you the truth&mdash;I
love you, Ida&mdash;I love you!"</p>

<p>He caught her hands in his, and she was too bewildered
and dazed to withdraw them.</p>

<p>"You must forgive me!" he cried. "Have pity on
me, if my words do not please you!"</p>

<p>She was carried away by his reckless impetuosity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
was too much surprised to interrupt him. She had not
even recovered herself sufficiently to withdraw her
hands from his. All she knew, in her bewilderment,
was, that he was kneeling upon the grass at her feet,
with his head bent, and that hot, passionate tears were
falling from his eyes.</p>

<p>"I have brought you here because I could not bear the
pain any longer. I must speak to you or die. I love
you! Ah, Heaven knows how I love you!"</p>

<p>She had no power to stop the torrent of words that
fell from his lips.</p>

<p>"You will no doubt wonder how I dare say this to
you," he went on, brokenly, "but my answer is&mdash;love
dares anything. It must express itself in action
or words. No mortal can keep it back."</p>

<p>She tried to check him, but it was impossible.</p>

<p>"Hush&mdash;hush!" was all she could say.</p>

<p>"I know the gulf that lies between us," he went on:
"I realize that it can never be bridged over. If I had
met you first, I feel all would have ended differently.
You would have loved me as I love you. I feel it&mdash;I
know it."</p>

<p>At that moment Eugene Mallard, who had hurried
down the path at the suggestion of Vivian Deane, arrived
upon the scene.</p>

<p>Only the tall lilac bushes sheltered him from the two
who stood by the brook-side. For a moment he was
horrified at what he saw and heard. He stood fairly
rooted to the spot. His first impulse was to dash in
upon them, fling Arthur Hollis to the earth, and beat
his very life out.</p>

<p>His next impulse was to rush to the house for his
revolver, return with it, and shoot his false friend
before his guilty wife's eyes.</p>

<p>He acted upon the latter impulse, turned on his heel,
and a moment later, white as death, he dashed into
the house and ran up a rear stair-way to his room.</p>

<p>He did not love the girl who bore his name, but she
should learn, even if it were at the cost of a life, what
it meant to drag his name, his honor, through the mire.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XLI" id="CHAPTER_XLI">CHAPTER XLI.</a></h2>


<p>Although scarcely five minutes had elapsed since Eugene
Mallard dashed into the house in search of his revolver,
when he returned to the brook-side neither his
wife nor Arthur Hollis was to be seen.</p>

<p>His rage was so great that he could scarcely contain
himself. In his present state of mind he did not dare
return to his guests, lest his emotion should betray him.</p>

<p>He thought they were planning an elopement; but he
would nip that in the bud.</p>

<p>The woman to whom he had given his name should
not disgrace him. He determined upon that as he hurried
up a rear stair-way to his wife's apartments to
verify his suspicions.</p>

<p>To his utter surprise, as he flung open the door, he saw
her sitting by the window. She sprung to her feet, looking
at him with widely distended eyes.</p>

<p>It was the first time that her husband had ever crossed
the threshold of her apartments.</p>

<p>He entered the room, closed the door behind him, and
stood with folded arms before her.</p>

<p>Husband and wife looked at each other.</p>

<p>It was he who broke the awful silence. He strode up
to her, and seized her wrist in a vise-like grasp.</p>

<p>"There is little use in making a preliminary speech,"
he cried, hoarsely. "I will come to the point at once!"</p>

<p>His face was ghastly, his lips trembled with uncontrollable
rage.</p>

<p>Ida, pale, terrified, wondering, gazed at him with undisguised
terror in her eyes.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she gasped.</p>

<p>"You guilty woman!" cried Eugene Mallard&mdash;"you
cruel, guilty woman, I have interrupted you in your
preparation for flight, it seems!"</p>

<p>His stern face, the anger that shone in his eyes, and
the harsh voice frightened her. She shrunk back as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
though he had struck her. Her lips parted as though she
would speak; but all sound died away on them.</p>

<p>"It is time," said Eugene Mallard, "that we came to
a clear understanding. In every way you have deceived
me! I have been fatally betrayed! Your shameless
flirtation has tarnished my name and lowered my position!
I am ashamed to look men in the face! Where
is he?" he demanded, looking about him, as though he
expected to see Arthur Hollis in the room.</p>

<p>"Down by the brook," she faltered.</p>

<p>Eugene laughed a harsh, satirical laugh.</p>

<p>"He must have seen me coming while he waited there
for you, and fled from my wrath." He turned on his
heel. "I repeat, if you stir from this room until I give
you leave, it will end in a tragedy!"</p>

<p>In his anger, he did not see that he was trampling under
foot a noble heart. If she had been able to calmly
explain to him just what had occurred, she might have
been saved. She attempted to speak, but he held up his
hand.</p>

<p>"Not one word!" he cried. "I will not listen!"</p>

<p>He turned suddenly, hurried from the room, closed the
door after him, and went quickly to his library, where he
could be alone.</p>

<p>Ida, left alone, reeled into the nearest chair. She shook
as if in an ague; she was cold, and her head reeled. Her
keen pain and agony kept her from fainting.</p>

<p>She tried to imagine her future life. What was Eugene
Mallard about to do? Her future was now ruined, sacrificed.
Eugene Mallard had been cold and indifferent
to her before, now he hated her.</p>

<p>He said she was to remain in that room until he should
return. She flung herself face downward upon the floor.
He had called her guilty and cruel; he had vented his
rage upon her. Her brain was dizzy with the unusual
excitement.</p>

<p>When Vivian Deane glided into Ida's room to find out
what was going on, to see whether Ida had really eloped,
she found her in a deep swoon. She did not call the
servants, but set about reviving her herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Ida lay white and still as one dead. Above her bent
Vivian Deane, half terrified at the result of her work.
Very soon her labors were rewarded, and Ida opened her
large, dark eyes.</p>

<p>"Vivian&mdash;Vivian!" she murmured, catching at the
arms of her false friend, her teeth chattering.</p>

<p>The blinding tears that now fell from Ida's eyes was
a mercy sent directly from Heaven, for they saved the
hapless young wife from going mad.</p>

<p>"Something has gone wrong with you, my dear,"
said Vivian, in her sweetest, most cooing voice. "Tell
me what it is, Ida, dear. Let me console and comfort
you."</p>

<p>Another fit of sobbing more violent than the first, and
Ida threw herself into the arms of her treacherous
friend, sobbing out:</p>

<p>"Oh! Vivian, I must tell some one."</p>

<p>In a voice that shook with emotion, she proceeded to
confide to her enemy what had happened down by the
brook-side, adding that her husband had discovered it in
some way, and accused her of encouraging Arthur Hollis.</p>

<p>"Even if you had given him encouragement, no one
could have blamed you," Vivian said in a soft, purring
voice, "for your husband's neglect has been noticeable
by every one!"</p>

<p>"But I did not encourage him!" cried Ida, in agony.
"He was pleasant company, but I thought no more of
him, even though I spent so much of my time in his society,
than I did of Captain Drury, or any of the other
guests beneath this roof. Oh! I do wish I were dead&mdash;I
do&mdash;I do!"</p>

<p>In this exaggerated feeling of one ill in body and in
mind, in a state of nervous tension, a true friend would
have shown the unhappy Ida that her position was not
so desperate and hopeless as she imagined. Matters
could not, however, be carried to an extremity without an
explanation.</p>

<p>"He bid me to remain here until he should return,"
sobbed Ida. "What do you suppose he means to do?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you really want my honest opinion?" asked Vivian,
with a steely glitter in her blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes!" said the young wife, anxiously, fairly holding
her breath in suspense.</p>

<p>"Well, then, my dear, if you must have it, here it is:
I, who know the fierce temper of the Mallards, say to
you that I think he intends to call all the guests here, to
openly denounce you before them, and then turn you
away from his house!"</p>

<p>The face of the girl-wife who listened grew ghastly.</p>

<p>"I would never stay beneath this roof to face his anger,"
said Vivian, her eyes glistening. "I would gather
up what money and jewels I could lay my hands on, and
run away&mdash;go as far away as possible."</p>

<p>"Would you?" cried Ida, in a hushed, awful voice.</p>

<p>"Yes," advised Vivian, firmly. "And every moment
of delay brings you nearer and nearer to face the terrible
ordeal that I am sure he intends to mete out to you!"</p>

<p>Ida rose suddenly to her feet</p>

<p>"I will do as you advise, Vivian," she whispered, her
dark eyes filled with terror. "I will fly at once!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XLII" id="CHAPTER_XLII">CHAPTER XLII.</a></h2>


<p>Vivian Deane looked down at the cowering girl at her
feet. It seemed to her then that her triumph was complete.
She could scarcely keep back the cry of exultation
that rose to her lips.</p>

<p>"How shall I leave the house without being seen?"
whispered Ida, piteously.</p>

<p>"Leave that to me," murmured Vivian. "I am very
sorry for you, Ida, and I will do all I can to aid you in
this, your hour of greatest sorrow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are, indeed, a true friend to me," sobbed Ida.
"I shall never, never forget your kindness."</p>

<p>Vivian looked a trifle uncomfortable at these words
of unmerited praise. She dared not remain longer with
Ida, for she knew that two or three partners would be
looking for her.</p>

<p>"Stay here for at least fifteen minutes," she said,
eagerly, "and by that time I will join you, and tell you
what plans I have made for you."</p>

<p>Ida could not think for herself, her brain was so benumbed.
She could only nod in silence.</p>

<p>Scarcely five minutes had elapsed since Vivian had
quitted the <i>boudoir</i>, until Eugene Mallard again knocked
for admittance at the door.</p>

<p>There was no answer. He turned the knob, entered,
and found his young wife lying senseless upon the carpet.
For the second time, Ida had given away to the
awful agony that consumed her. Among those at the
<i>fte</i> was a young doctor. Eugene summoned him hastily.</p>

<p>"Dear me, this is quite serious!" exclaimed the doctor,
as he bent over the prostrate form which Eugene
had borne to a couch. "Your wife has brain fever. It
is a serious case, I fear."</p>

<p>The garden-party broke up quite suddenly. The news
that Mrs. Mallard had been taken ill was rumored among
the revelers, and silently but quickly the guests took their
departure, all save Vivian Deane.</p>

<p>She went up to Eugene, and laid a hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"Let me remain and nurse my dear friend Ida," she
pleaded. "Do not refuse, I beg of you!"</p>

<p>"Let it be as the doctor says," answered Eugene.</p>

<p>But the physician shook his head decisively.</p>

<p>"This is a case requiring the most competent nurses.
I am sorry to refuse you, Miss Deane, but in this instance
I must do so."</p>

<p>Vivian controlled the anger that leaped into her heart.</p>

<p>"You certainly mean well," added the doctor, "but
in such a case as this even her nearest relatives are not
to be allowed in the sick-room."</p>

<p>Vivian was obliged to swallow her chagrin as best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
she could. If she had been allowed her way, the young
wife who had come between her love and herself would
never rise from her bed.</p>

<p>"When she is convalescing I will visit her," she said
to herself.</p>

<p>As she had no excuse to remain longer in the house,
she was obliged to take her departure along with the
other guests.</p>

<p>When Eugene Mallard had hurried to his room, after
bidding Ida to remain there until his return, it was his
intention to go to his room for writing materials, and returning
to Ida, force from her a written confession of
her love for his friend, and her intention to elope with
him.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, he could not very well carry
his plan into execution. His rage against his hapless
young wife turned to pity when he saw her lying there so
helplessly before him.</p>

<p>During the fortnight that followed, the servants, who
knew of their master's estrangement from his young
wife, and how little he cared for her, were greatly surprised
to find themselves banished from the sick-room,
while Eugene Mallard took possession of it.</p>

<p>The fact was, he was puzzled at her raving. Sometimes,
when taking the place of the trained nurse for an
hour, he was troubled beyond expression to hear her go
over again and again the scene that had taken place by
the brook.</p>

<p>In her delirium, Ida vehemently repulsed Arthur Hollis,
demanding of him how it was that he dared speak a
word of love to her, the wife of another.</p>

<p>Then the scene would change, and she would fancy
herself once more in her own room, falling on her knees
and crying out to Heaven that she could not bear her
husband's coldness.</p>

<p>Often would Eugene listen intently while Ida clasped
her hands and moaned:</p>

<p>"Oh, Eugene! Eugene! will I ever be more to you
than I am now? I love you! Yes, I love you, but you
will never know it! If you only knew it, you would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
surprised. A wife never loved a husband more dearly, more
devotedly than I love you. I would have devoted my
whole life to you. I would have died for you! Every
beat of my heart, every thought of my mind, every action
of my life is for you! I love you as no one else ever will,
as no one has loved you! You may live many years,
happy, flattered by the women of the world, but no love
like mine will ever come to you. The wife who is to you
as the dirt beneath your feet is the truest friend you
have!"</p>

<p>Eugene Mallard looked terribly distressed as he listened.</p>

<p>"Ida, my dear wife, listen to me," he would say. "I&mdash;I&mdash;shall
try very hard to be kinder to you than I have
been. Do you hear me, do you understand?"</p>

<p>There was no gleam of love in the pale face; no light
such as he had thought his words would bring there; no
gleam of joy. She did not seem to understand him. He
said to himself that he must be cautious; that he must not
distress her by speaking words that would give her hope.</p>

<p>The news of the illness of Eugene Mallard's young
wife had traversed far beyond the small Virginia town.
He was well known in New York, and the papers of the
metropolis copied the bit of news; but in doing so, they
made a great mistake. The items read that the young
wife of Eugene Mallard had died from the effects of
brain fever.</p>

<p>Miss Fernly read the article, and without delay she
wrote to Eugene Mallard.</p>

<p>In one part of her letter she said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">"I should never have written you the following if the
wife whom you had wedded through <i>my</i> mistake had
lived. But now that she is gone, I will tell you the truth&mdash;that
hapless deed came very near costing your poor
Hildegarde her life. From the time of your marriage to
the present, she has never been the same. She loved you
then, she still loves you.</p>

<p>"This is what I would advise you to do: wait a reasonable
length of time, and then come and claim Hildegarde,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
and this time nothing shall happen to prevent the
marriage of you two whom Heaven had intended for
each other. I know Hildegarde is breaking her heart
day by day, hour by hour, for love of you.</p>

<p>"I urge you to come to her just as soon as you think
it prudent, as I think it is my duty to warn you that
Hildegarde is fading away before our very eyes, and
your presence is the only thing that can save her life.</p>

<p>"I here inclose you a small portrait of her I had taken
only a little while ago. Her face is as sweet as a flower,
but, ah, me! one can not help but read the sadness in
every line of it."</p>
</blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">It was just at the time when Eugene Mallard was
feeling kinder toward his wife than ever that he received
Miss Fernly's letter inclosing Hildegarde's picture. He
had done his best to try to crush out his hopeless love for
one from whom Heaven had so strangely parted him.</p>

<p>Great drops of perspiration stood out on his brow as
he folded the letter and turned the picture face downward
on his desk.</p>

<p>It seemed to Eugene that the bitter waves of death
were sweeping over him. It was the reopening of the
old wound in his heart that he prayed Heaven to heal.
He loved Hildegarde with all the strength of his manhood.
He wished that he were dead. The pain seemed
greater than he could bear. He found that he still loved
sweet Hildegarde; but he was bound to another in honor
and conscience. He would try to do his duty toward
the one who bore his name.</p>

<p>He took the letter to the open fire-place, where a log
fire burned lazily, and knelt down before it, holding it to
the flame. Red tongues of fire caught at it gleefully, and
the next instant it was a heap of ashes in one corner of
the grate.</p>

<p>Then he held out the picture to the flames, but involuntarily
he drew it back. He could not allow it to burn. It
seemed to him that his own heart would burn first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Heaven give me strength to destroy it!" he cried.
"I dare not trust myself to keep it. It will drive me
mad!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XLIII" id="CHAPTER_XLIII">CHAPTER XLIII.</a></h2>


<p>The flames touched the portrait, and with a cry Eugene
Mallard hastily drew it back.</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;a thousand times no!" It would be as easy to
burn the living, beating heart in his bosom.</p>

<p>While he had the strength, he hurried to his writing-desk,
placed it in a pigeon-hole, shut down the lid, and
turned the key. Then he buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p>He ruminated upon the strangeness of the position he
was placed in. Both of these young girls loved him, while
he loved but one of them, and the one whom he loved so
deeply could never be anything in this world to him. He
wondered in what way he had offended Heaven that such
a fate should be meted out to him.</p>

<p>At that moment quite a thrilling scene was transpiring
at the railway station of the little Virginia town.</p>

<p>The New York Express, which had just steamed in,
stood before it, and from one of the drawing-room cars
there stepped a handsome man dressed in the height of
fashion.</p>

<p>He sauntered into the waiting-room, looking about him
as though in search of the ticket-agent.</p>

<p>A woman entered the depot at that moment carrying a
little child in her arms. She recognized the man at a
single glance.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Royal Ainsley!" she cried, "is this indeed
you returning to your old home?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Turning hastily around at the mention of his name,
he beheld Mrs. Lester standing before him.</p>

<p>"Yes; I have returned like a bad penny, Mrs. Lester,"
he said, with a light, flippant laugh. "But, judging
from the expression on your face, you are not glad to
see me."</p>

<p>"I have not said so," she answered.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Mrs. Lester," he said, flinging himself
down on one of the benches. "I should like to inquire
of you about the women-folk of the village."</p>

<p>The woman sat down beside him, in obedience to his
request.</p>

<p>"There is very little to tell," she answered; "everything
in our village moves on about the same, year in and
year out. Nothing of importance has taken place, except
the marriage of your cousin, Eugene Mallard."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha! So my fastidious cousin has changed
his name from Royal Ainsley to that of Eugene Mallard
to please his uncle, has he? Well, I read of it in one of
the New York papers, but I scarcely credited it. Between
you and me, Mrs. Lester, that was a mighty mean piece
of work&mdash;the old fool leaving his entire fortune to him,
and cutting me off without a cent."</p>

<p>"Every one knows that you were warned of what
was to come unless you mended your ways," answered
the woman.</p>

<p>"Bah! I never thought for a moment that the old fool
would keep his word," retorted the other. "But you say
that my cousin is wedded. That is indeed news to me.
Whom did he wed&mdash;Vivian Deane?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she answered, "not Miss Deane. Every
one in the village prophesied that he wouldn't wed her,
although she was so infatuated with him."</p>

<p>"I suppose she is an heiress," said Ainsley, savagely
knocking the ashes off his cigar. "It's easy enough to
marry another fortune if you have one already."</p>

<p>"I don't know if she is an heiress," returned Mrs. Lester;
"but she's a real lady. Any one can see that. But
I fear that he is in great danger of losing her. She is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
now very low with brain fever, and it is doubtful whether
she will live."</p>

<p>"Humph!" he muttered. "My visit here is most inopportune
then. I wanted to see my cousin, and strike
him for the loan of a few thousand dollars. He won't be
in very good humor now to accede to my request. I think
I'll keep shady and wait a fortnight before seeing him.
But who is <i>this</i>?" he cried, looking at the child she carried
in her arms. "I understood that your baby died."</p>

<p>"So it did," replied Mrs. Lester. "This is the little
foundling whom we are about to adopt. My husband
brought it to me from a foundling asylum."</p>

<p>"Well, I do declare!" said Ainsley. "That's quite a
risky operation, taking a little waif into your home, when
you don't know its parents."</p>

<p>"But I <i>do</i> know its mother," she answered. "I wrote
and found out all about its mother. She was a young
girl who was taken ill in the streets. A poor family permitted
her to be brought into their house, and there her
babe was born. The young mother was so ill that the
babe was taken to the foundling asylum by the doctor
who attended her, where it could have constant attention,
for its little life was despaired of. By a strange mistake,
word was sent to the mother that the little one had died.
But the baby rallied and recovered. Almost heart-broken
over the news of its death, the young mother disappeared.
There was no one so interested as to make search for her,
and tell her that her little one had been spared. In her
flight she left behind her a package which contained some
articles that may lead to her identity, if the child should
ever want to find her hapless mother when she grows to
womanhood. I have them with me now. Do let me show
them to you, Mr. Ainsley."</p>

<p>At that moment the little one, who had been sleeping,
slowly opened its great, dark, solemn eyes, looked up
into the face of Royal Ainsley, and uttered a plaintive
little sob.</p>

<p>It was not often that he noticed little children&mdash;indeed,
he had an aversion to them&mdash;but he could not understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the impulse that made him bend forward and look with
interest into the flower-like little face.</p>

<p>Where had he seen just such a face? The great, dark,
solemn eyes, so like purple pansies, held him spell-bound.</p>

<p>An impulse which he could not control or define caused
him to reach out his trembling hand and touch the waxen
little fingers, and the contact made the blood rush
through his veins like fire. He tried to speak, but his
tongue seemed too thick and heavy to perform its functions.</p>

<p>The woman did not notice his agitation. She was
busily engaged in unwrapping a small parcel which she
had tied up in oil silk.</p>

<p>Then, to his astonished gaze, Mrs. Lester held up before
him a beautiful bracelet made of tiny pink sea-shells,
with a heavy gold clasp, upon which was engraved,
"From R. to I."</p>

<p>If Mrs. Lester had but looked at him, she would have
seen that his face had grown ghastly.</p>

<p>At a glance he recognized the bracelet as one which
he had designed and presented to Ida May, at Newport,
when he believed her to be the heiress of the wealthy
Mays.</p>

<p>"That is not all," said Mrs. Lester, holding up a man's
pocket-book, which he recognized as his own&mdash;-the identical
one he had sent up to Ida May by the porter, with a
little change in it, on the morning he deserted her.</p>

<p>Again he opened his mouth to speak; but no sound
issued from his lips. The pocket-book contained only
a part of a sleeve-link that had belonged to himself, the
other part of the link was in his pocket at that moment.</p>

<p>In a flash, the truth came to him&mdash;this little one was
Ida May's child.</p>

<p>He now recalled the appealing letters she had written
to him at the hotel after he had deserted her. He had
never answered them, for by that time he was trying to
win the beautiful heiress, Florence St. John. He had
told Ida May that his marriage to her was not legal,
while in truth it was as binding as Church and State
could make it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>He had cast all upon the throw of a dice, and it would
never do for the poor young girl whom he had married to
come between him and the young girl whom he was about
to win.</p>

<p>He had resolved upon a desperate scheme to gain a
fortune, by deluding the young girl whom he had made
his wife into believing that she was not such, and going
through the ceremony with the heiress, Florence St. John.</p>

<p>But Fate had snatched the beautiful Florence St. John
from his grasp just as he was about to wed her. Her
brother came on the scene, and Royal Ainsley beat a
hasty retreat, as he had commenced to inquire into his
antecedents.</p>

<p>All these thoughts flashed through his brain in an instant.
Then he realized that Mrs. Lester was speaking
to him.</p>

<p>"A pretty baby, is she not?" said the woman, holding
the infant toward him. "But we have decided not to
keep her, after all. I am going to take the first train to
New York, and return the baby to the foundling asylum,
though Heaven knows I shall miss her sorely. We are
too poor to keep her."</p>

<p>Royal Ainsley turned toward her with strange eagerness.</p>

<p>"What do you say if I take your charge off your
hands?" he asked, huskily.</p>

<p>"You, Mr. Ainsley?" exclaimed the woman, amazed.
"Why, what in the world could <i>you</i>, a young bachelor,
do with a baby?"</p>

<p>"I will give you one hundred dollars to give me the
child. Is it a bargain, Mrs. Lester? Speak quickly, before
I change my mind!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XLIV" id="CHAPTER_XLIV">CHAPTER XLIV.</a></h2>


<p>Royal Ainsley leaned forward, and caught Mrs. Lester's
arm, saying hastily:</p>

<p>"I repeat, that you shall have one hundred dollars if
you will but give the child into my custody."</p>

<p>"Again I ask, what could you, a bachelor, do with it,
Mr. Ainsley?" said Mrs. Lester.</p>

<p>He had an answer ready for her.</p>

<p>"I know a family who lost a little one, and would be
only too delighted to take the infant and give it a good
home."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lester breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"I am very poor, as you know very well, Mr. Ainsley,"
she answered, "and I can not refuse your kind offer.
Take the little one with welcome. Only be sure that it is
a good home you consign it to."</p>

<p>He counted out the money and handed it to her, and
she resigned the infant to his arms. At that moment
they heard the shriek of the incoming express.</p>

<p>"That is the train I was going to take," she said, "and
now I am out the price of my ticket, which I bought in
advance."</p>

<p>"If you will give it to me, I will use it," he said.</p>

<p>She handed him the ticket, and in another moment
Mrs. Lester saw him board the train with the child.</p>

<p>"I wonder if I have done right or wrong," she thought,
a scared look coming into her face. "It was all done so
quickly that I had not the time to consider the matter.
But this much I do know; I have the hundred dollars in
my pocket, and that is a God-send to me. We need the
money badly just now."</p>

<p>She turned and walked slowly away; but somehow
she did not seem quite easy regarding the fate of the little
child.</p>

<p>"I ought to have asked him the name of the family to
whom he was going to take the baby," she mused; "then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
I could have written to them to be very careful, and to
bring her up to be a good and true woman. I shall certainly
ask him all about it the very next time I see him&mdash;that
is, if I ever <i>do</i> see him."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the train thundered on, carrying Royal
Ainsley and the child away. It was hard to keep back the
expression of mingled hatred and rage with which Royal
Ainsley regarded the infant he held in his arms. He
knew full well that the child was his own, but he had
no love for it. If it had died then and there, that fact
would have afforded him much satisfaction.</p>

<p>But one course presented itself. He would take it to
New York, and once there, he would have no further
trouble with it&mdash;he would manage to lose it. Many
waifs were found on the doorsteps, and no one ever could
trace their parentage, or whose hand had placed them
there.</p>

<p>In all probability he would never run across Ida May
again. She believed her child dead.</p>

<p>While these thoughts were flitting through his brain,
the little one commenced to cry. Its piteous wails attracted
the attention of more than one person in the car.</p>

<p>"Mother," said a buxom young woman sitting opposite,
"I am sure that young man is a widower, left with
the little child, and he is taking it to his folks. You see
he is in deep mourning.</p>

<p>"I'll bet that baby's hungry, mother, and I'll bet, too,
that he hasn't a nursing-bottle to feed it from."</p>

<p>"You can depend upon it that he has one," remarked
her mother. "Every father knows that much about
babies."</p>

<p>"Of course he has it in his pocket; he never came
away without one; but he is so deeply engrossed in his
own thoughts that he does not hear the baby. Don't you
think you ought to give him a little reminder of it?" said
her daughter, thoughtfully. "You're an elderly woman,
and can do it."</p>

<p>"He might tell me to mind my own business," said the
elder woman. "Some strangers don't take kindly to
other people meddling in their affairs."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>As the plaintive wails of the infant increased instead
of diminished, the elder woman got up and made her
way up the aisle.</p>

<p>Royal Ainsley started violently as he felt the heavy
hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Why don't you feed your baby, sir?" she said,
brusquely.</p>

<p>He looked at her angrily, his brows bent together in a
decided frown.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by interrupting my thoughts,
woman?" he cried, harshly.</p>

<p>His angry retort roused all the antagonism in the
woman's nature.</p>

<p>"I mean just what I say&mdash;your baby's hungry, mister,"
she replied. "If you had the feelings of a loving
father, you'd know enough to feed it."</p>

<p>He looked at her in consternation.</p>

<p>"Feed it?" he echoed, blankly. "I&mdash;I was not prepared
for anything like this. Such a thing did not occur
to me."</p>

<p>"And you didn't bring a nursing-bottle along with
you?" echoed the woman.</p>

<p>"No," he responded, curtly, but also somewhat blankly.</p>

<p>"Good Lord! that's just like a man, to forget important
things like that."</p>

<p>"What am I to do?" he asked, appealingly. "What
would you suggest, madame. I am at sea."</p>

<p>She looked at him perplexedly; then her motherly face
brightened as she glanced about the car.</p>

<p>"I will soon see what can be done," she answered,
making her way as quickly as the moving train would
allow to the end of the car, where two women sat with
tiny infants on their laps.</p>

<p>Very soon she returned with the article she had gone
in search of.</p>

<p>"Let me take the poor little thing," she said, "and
feed it. Men, and more especially young men, don't
know anything about such things."</p>

<p>Royal Ainsley gladly delivered his charge into her
keeping. Very soon the woman had stilled its cries, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
it was sleeping peacefully in her arms. An idea then
came to Royal Ainsley. His pale-blue eyes glittered with
a fiendish light.</p>

<p>He almost laughed aloud at the thought that flashed
through his mind.</p>

<p>"Do you think the baby will sleep a little while?" he
asked, drawing his hat down over his face.</p>

<p>"It is likely to," she answered; "still, one can not
always tell. Samantha, my daughter here, never slept
ten minutes on a stretch when she was a baby. She was
a lot of trouble to me then; but I don't mind
it now, for she's a heap of comfort to me, sir. I wouldn't
know how to get along without Samantha. She&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Royal Ainsley interrupted her impatiently.</p>

<p>"I was going to say that if you would be kind enough
to hold the little one for awhile I would like to go into
the smoking-car and smoke a cigar."</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XLV" id="CHAPTER_XLV">CHAPTER XLV.</a></h2>


<p>Royal Ainsley thought the woman did not hear his
question, for she did not answer, and he repeated, in
his suave, winning way:</p>

<p>"Could I trouble you to hold the little one a few moments,
while I enjoy a smoke in the car ahead?"</p>

<p>Widow Jones answered readily enough:</p>

<p>"To be sure I will take care of the little one, sir. Go
right along and enjoy your cigar. I know just how a
man feels when he is deprived of a smoke. My husband
had to have his pipe every night after his supper, just
as sure as the sun went down. If he missed it, he was
fairly beside himself&mdash;like a fish out of water."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>It suddenly occurred to Royal Ainsley that it wouldn't
be a bad idea to know more about this woman.</p>

<p>"Do you live near here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Just three stations above&mdash;near Larchmont village.
We won't reach there for nearly three-quarters of an
hour, so that need not trouble you, sir. I take it that you
are a widower, sir," she went on, before he could rise
from his seat.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, shortly, and with considerable
impatience.</p>

<p>"It's too bad!" chimed in Samantha&mdash;"and to be left
with such a young baby, too. It's too bad that you
didn't get a nurse for her, unless you are taking her to
some of your folks."</p>

<p>"I have no relatives," he answered. "I am going to
New York for the express purpose of finding some one
to take care of the child."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Widow Jones. "How strange
that you should come across me! Why, do you know, I
used to take little ones in occasionally, and keep them
for their fathers until they were old enough to get about.
Before you look further, sir&mdash;although I don't like to
recommend myself&mdash;I'd like to have you stop off at
Larchmont and inquire all about me. There isn't a man,
woman, or child for miles around but can tell you about
me."</p>

<p>"Why, it is indeed a piece of good luck that I should
have come across you, madame!" declared Royal Ainsley.
"We may be able to come to terms here and now."</p>

<p>"Don't ask too much, ma," whispered Samantha, under
her breath.</p>

<p>"You can set your own price," said Royal Ainsley,
in an off-hand manner.</p>

<p>"Oh, I will leave that entirely to you, sir," said the
widow. "I'll take the baby and care for her, and you
can come and see her whenever you like. I'll leave the
pay entirely to you. That's fair enough, sir, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"You are entirely too magnanimous," he declared.
"By the way, here's a ten-dollar note to start with.
That's the only bill I have, save those of very large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
denomination. In the course of a few weeks I will make
permanent arrangements with you."</p>

<p>"But surely you are going to stop off at Larchmont,
sir, and see where I live. I don't expect that you will
trust a dear little baby like this to a stranger. You will
most likely want a recommendation."</p>

<p>"Your face is certainly recommendation enough, my
good woman," he declared. "Nevertheless, I shall, of
course, stop off with you."</p>

<p>He rose with a bow.</p>

<p>"Remember, sir," chimed in Samantha, "that part of the
train switches off just a few miles below there. If you
don't look out, you'll be taken on to New York."</p>

<p>"I must look out for that," he said. "I had certainly
intended to take a little nap after my smoke. I haven't
closed my eyes for two nights; the baby was not feeling
well. Your warning will put me on my guard, at all
events."</p>

<p>Again he bowed, and in an instant he had disappeared.</p>

<p>"I wonder what his name is," said Samantha. "You
forgot to ask him, ma."</p>

<p>"So I did, to be sure. But it's easy finding that out."</p>

<p>Further conversation was stopped by the sudden waking
up of the pretty dark-eyed babe; but a little milk
from the bottle and a few soothing words soon succeeded
in quieting her.</p>

<p>"We are almost at the switch," said Samantha.
"Ought not somebody go into the smoking-car and inform
the gentleman of it?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly not. It's likely he knows of it. He
was told of it, and it's likely some one will inform him.
You had better look after your boxes and bundles. Be
sure to pick up the bag of candy, the ginger-snaps, the
bunch of bachelor buttons, the rosemary, my shawl, and
your new pair of shoes."</p>

<p>"If I have to hold this baby and pick up my dress, it
will be as much as I can do. But I'm quite sure the gentleman
will come and take care of the baby himself,"
added Samantha, wistfully.</p>

<p>The conductor called out the station. It was the busiest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
junction in the northern part of Virginia. Two
trains met and passed each other here, while still another
was side-tracked, waiting for the right of way. There
was always a rush of people at the station, and consequently
confusion and noise. Widow Jones and Samantha
stepped from the car to the platform.</p>

<p>"We ought to have waited," declared the girl. "See,
we have missed him, as I told you we would. I had
better run back and see if he's there. He's probably
going on to New York. But he will be sure to see us, no
matter what car he is in."</p>

<p>A moment more, and the two trains moved on. Even
Widow Jones was now thoroughly alarmed. What her
daughter had feared had taken place. The young man
had certainly missed them.</p>

<p>"Overcome with fatigue, he probably fell asleep in
the smoking-car, in spite of himself," said Samantha.</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow he knows your name and address,
mother. He will be sure to telegraph back to us at
Larchmont."</p>

<p>Still, Widow Jones, who held the baby close in her

<p>"He has certainly been carried on to New York," said
Widow Jones. "There is nothing left but to get home
and await results."</p>

<p>"I guess you're about right," said Samantha.</p>

<p>They left word at the railroad station to at once bring
up any telegram that might come for them.</p>

<p>An hour after they arrived at Larchmont, every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
had heard of Mrs. Jones and the baby, and her experience
with the handsome stranger.</p>

<p>When a fortnight passed, and the weeks lengthened
into months, Mrs. Jones began to be a little skeptical.</p>

<p>"We will keep the baby until he <i>does</i> come for it, Samantha,"
she said.</p>

<p>Somehow the little waif with the great dark eyes and
the little rose-bud mouth had crept into their hearts, and
they could not turn it away.</p>

<p>Samantha did her share in looking after the baby; but
it was a little hard, for she had a great deal to do waiting
upon customers in the village bakery.</p>

<p>The mother and daughter made no further mention
of the handsome stranger.</p>

<p>"If we had but asked him his name. I wanted you
to, ma," declared Samantha. "But there's no use in
crying now. We have the satisfaction of having a baby,
anyhow," declared the girl, spiritedly.</p>

<p>"Yes," assented her mother, dubiously; "but it's quite
a task to bring up other people's children."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, freed from the care of the child, Royal
Ainsley walked through the train. It was just approaching
the station, when, all unobserved, he swung from the
back platform just as the express was moving out again.</p>

<p>A chuckle of delight broke from his lips.</p>

<p>"That was most cleverly managed. My compliments
to Mrs. Jones, of Larchmont. She has been exceedingly
useful to me."</p>

<p>He did not trouble himself as to what disposition they
might make of the child.</p>

<p>The question that occurred to him was&mdash;"how am I to
destroy the proofs I have concerning the child?"</p>

<p>But no answer came to him regarding this dilemma.
He thrust them back into his pocket. He would have
plenty of time to plan when he reached New York.</p>

<p>Suddenly the thought came to him, that he would be
foolish to turn back from the course he had marked out
for himself. Instead of returning, he would go back and
see Eugene.</p>

<p>There was a friend of his living in the vicinity. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
would find him, and pass a week or two with him, then
he would carry out his original scheme. He acted upon
this thought.</p>

<p>It was the fishing season, and Royal Ainsley made a
valuable addition to a party of young men already gathered
at his friend's quarters. Five weeks elapsed before
the party broke up.</p>

<p>"By this time Eugene's wife must have recovered
from her illness," he said, grimly. "If I don't go and
see him now, they will probably be getting ready to go
off somewhere, and I will miss them."</p>

<p>Suiting the action to the word, Royal Ainsley took the
train the next day and arrived at his native village at
dusk.</p>

<p>He had taken the precaution to provide himself with a
long top-coat and a slouch hat.</p>

<p>He avoided the depot and its waiting-room, lest he
should meet some one who might recognize him.</p>

<p>He struck into a side-path, and a sharp walk of some
fifteen minutes brought him in sight of the old mansion.</p>

<p>How dark and gloomy the night was! There was no
moon, and not a star shone in the heavens.</p>

<p>A short cut across the fields brought him to a little
brook. He looked down upon it in silence as it gurgled
on sullenly over its rocky bed.</p>

<p>He looked back at the grand old mansion looming up
in the distance. And as he looked, he clinched his hands,
and the bitterness in his heart became more intense.</p>

<p>"But for Eugene, all that would be mine," he muttered.
"He stepped between me and the fortune. When
we were boys together, I realized that he would do it, and
I hated him&mdash;hated him for his suave, winning ways and
the love which every one showered on him. He was always
lucky."</p>

<p>He turned and looked again at the great stone mansion,
whose turrets were dimly outlined against the sky.
And as he looked he saw a door on the rear porch open
and a figure clad in a white, fleecy dress glide out upon
the porch and walk slowly into the grounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is probably the bride," he muttered, with a
harsh little laugh.</p>

<p>To his surprise, she crossed the lawn and made directly
for the spot where he stood.</p>

<p>"I shall not be likely to get a good look at her unless
the moon comes out," he thought.</p>

<p>He drew back into the shadow of the alders that skirted
the brook. His bitter, vengeful thoughts were turned
aside for a moment while watching the advancing figure.</p>

<p>"Why should my cousin have wealth, love, happiness,
while I have to knock about here and there, getting my
living as best I can, being always in hard luck and a
mark for the arrows of relentless fate?" he soliloquized.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer drew the slender, graceful figure.</p>

<p>Royal Ainsley was right. It was his cousin's wife.</p>

<p>She went on slowly over the greensward in the sweet
night air, little dreaming what lay at the end of her path.</p>

<p>By the merest chance the hapless young wife had come
across the letter that Miss Fernly had written to Eugene
Mallard. It had fallen from his pocket when he was
looking over some papers on the porch one day.</p>

<p>Passing by soon after, Ida saw the paper lying there,
picked it up, and opened it. There, while the sun shone
and the birds sung, she read it through, and the wonder
was that she did not die then and there.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XLVII" id="CHAPTER_XLVII">CHAPTER XLVII.</a></h2>


<p>From the moment that Ida had learned through Miss
Fernly's letter how Hildegarde Cramer had mourned for
her lover, the young wife's life had become very unhappy.</p>

<p>She knew well that she stood between Hildegarde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Cramer and her happiness. She had done her best to
die, but Heaven had not so willed it.</p>

<p>The pity of it was that her love for Eugene Mallard
had increased a hundred fold. It was driving her to
madness.</p>

<p>"Oh, if it were all ended!" she cried aloud. "Better
anything than this awful despair!"</p>

<p>No one heard her. There was no one near to hear
what she moaned out to the brook that kept so many
secrets.</p>

<p>She heard a crash in the branches near by&mdash;a slight
crash, but she started. It was only a bird that had fallen
from its nest in the tree overhead, she told herself.</p>

<p>But even after she had said it she felt a sense of uncontrollable
terror that she could not account for; felt the
weight of some strange presence.</p>

<p>That voice!</p>

<p>When Ida cried aloud in her despair, the words fell like
an electric shock upon the ears of a man who listened
behind the alder branches.</p>

<p>"By all that is wonderful!" he cried, under his breath.
"Either my ears have deceived me, or that is the voice
of Ida May! Well, well! Will surprises never cease?"</p>

<p>He stepped quickly forward, and the next moment he
was by her side. How strange it was that at that instant
the moon came out from behind a cloud and rendered
every object as bright as if in the noonday sun.</p>

<p>At the sound of the step, Ida started back in affright.</p>

<p>One glance into the face looking down into her own
and she started back with a cry that was scarcely human.</p>

<p>"You!" she gasped.</p>

<p>Then her lips grew cold and stiff. She could not utter
another word.</p>

<p>"The surprise is mutual!" he answered. "What in
the name of all that is wonderful are you doing in this
house? Come, my dear, let us sit down on this log while
you explain matters."</p>

<p>Ida drew back in loathing.</p>

<p>"Stand back!" she cried. "Do not attempt to touch
me, or I shall cry out for help!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>A fierce imprecation broke from the man's lips.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by all this high and mighty nonsense?"
he cried. "Speak at once. You are my wife!
Why shouldn't I lay hands on you?"</p>

<p>"No!" she cried. "Though you have so cruelly deceived
me, I thank God that I am not your wife."</p>

<p>He threw back his fair, handsome head, and a laugh
that was not pleasant to hear fell from his lips.</p>

<p>"Don't make any mistake about that!" he cried. "I
remember what I wrote you&mdash;that there was some illegality
in the ceremony which made our marriage invalid.
But I learned afterward, when I met the chap who performed
the ceremony, that it was entirely legal. If you
doubt that what I say is true, I can easily convince you
of the truth of my assertion."</p>

<p>Ida drew back with a cry so awful that he looked at
her.</p>

<p>"Well, well, who can understand the ways of
women?" he remarked, ironically. "I thought that you
would rejoice over the fact that our marriage was legal,
but I find that you are sorry."</p>

<p>Still she was looking at him with wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>"I can not, I will not believe anything so horrible!"
she gasped. "It would drive me mad!"</p>

<p>"I assure you it is true," he declared. "Like yourself,
I believed that the marriage was not binding. But I
found it was, and that saved me from wedding another
girl."</p>

<p>A cry that seemed to rend her heart in twain broke
from her white lips.</p>

<p>"But tell me, what are you doing here?" he asked,
wonderingly.</p>

<p>Then it was that something like an inkling of the truth
came to him.</p>

<p>"Great God!" he cried, "it can not be possible that
you are in any way connected with my cousin&mdash;that you
are the bride he brought home? Speak! Why are you
trembling so? Has my guess come anywhere near the
mark?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Ida looked up at him with wild, frightened eyes like
those of a hunted deer.</p>

<p>"Speak!" he cried again, fiercely grasping her arm,
"or I will wring the truth from you!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I am Eugene Mallard's wife," she whispered in
a voice that would have touched any other man's heart
than the one who was bending over her with rage depicted
on his face.</p>

<p>He laughed aloud, and that laugh was horrible to hear.</p>

<p>She did not spare herself. She told him all the bitter
truth&mdash;how, being thrown in contact with Eugene Mallard
day after day, she had learned to love him with all
the strength of her nature; how, seeing how good, kind
and true he was&mdash;a king among men&mdash;she fell face
downward in the dew-wet grass and cried out to Heaven
that her life would cease the moment she went out of
Eugene Mallard's life.</p>

<p>"This is, indeed, a fine state of affairs!" he cried out.</p>

<p>"What would you have me do?" cried the unhappy
young girl in the voice of one dying.</p>

<p>He did not answer her at once; but, taking a cigar
from his pocket, he coolly lighted it.</p>

<p>"When you are through with your hysterics, we will
talk the matter over," he assented, frowningly.</p>

<p>She struggled to her feet.</p>

<p>"Sit down!" he commanded, pointing to the trunk of
a tree.</p>

<p>Feeling more dead than alive, she sat down in the place
which he had indicated. She expected that her life
would end at any moment, the tension on her nerves was
so great.</p>

<p>He did not speak; but the short, harsh laugh that broke
from his lips, as he puffed away at his cigar, was more
cruel than the harshest words.</p>

<p>"This is what one might call a melodrama in real life,"
he said, at length. "It savors of comedy, too, and illustrates
fully the old saying: 'Truth is often stranger than
fiction!' But, to get down to business. Turn around
and face me, while I tell you the injunction I lay upon
you, and which you dare not refuse to obey!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XLVIII" id="CHAPTER_XLVIII">CHAPTER XLVIII.</a></h2>


<p>The hapless young wife looked into the hard, set face
above her, her eyes dilating with fear.</p>

<p>Her brain reeled; it seemed to her that she was dying.</p>

<p>"Listen to what I have to say," exclaimed Royal Ainsley,
his hand tightening on her shoulder. "You have a
fine home here&mdash;much finer than I could possibly offer
you&mdash;and I propose that you shall keep it. There is no
use in wasting sentiment between us. We do not care
for each other, and you <i>do</i> care for Eugene Mallard. It
will be some satisfaction for you to live beneath this roof,
and I won't mind it at all, providing you make it worth
my while. I will make my meaning clearer to you. I
must have some money, and you are the one who must
help me to it. Get a thousand dollars, and I will go away
and never again molest you. Come, now, what do you
say?"</p>

<p>Ida drew back and looked at him.</p>

<p>"You know that I could not get it for you," she said,
with calmness.</p>

<p>"You know the alternative," he said, harshly.</p>

<p>"No matter what the alternative is, I&mdash;I could not
help you," she answered, huskily.</p>

<p>"If you refuse," he went on, "I can have Eugene
Mallard and yourself arrested for bigamy. I can send
you both to prison, and, so help me Heaven, I'll do it!
You say that you love Eugene Mallard. We will see if
you love him well enough to save him."</p>

<p>"You monster!" she gasped, wildly, "you would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
do such a thing, I say. You dare not outrage Heaven
like that."</p>

<p>"The shoe is on the other foot. It is <i>you</i> who have
outraged Heaven in violating the law. I must have that
money, and you know I am a desperate man."</p>

<p>He would not tell her just now that her child was alive.
He would save that piece of news for some other time.</p>

<p>Before she could reply, they saw some of the servants
crossing the lawn.</p>

<p>"I must go!" she cried, wrenching herself free from
his grasp. "They have come in search of me!"</p>

<p>"I shall be here to-morrow night at this very spot
awaiting your answer," he said, harshly.</p>

<p>Why had Heaven let Royal Ainsley find her? Had he
not already brought misery enough into her life?</p>

<p>She turned the matter over in her mind. Every word
he had said, every threat he had made, occurred to her.</p>

<p>Would he make good his threat, and take vengeance
upon the man she loved if she refused to raise one thousand
dollars for him?</p>

<p>She knew he was what he had said&mdash;a desperate man.</p>

<p>Oh, if she had but dared creep into the library, throw
herself at Eugene Mallard's feet, and tell him all, what
woe would have been spared her. But, alas! she dared
not.</p>

<p>Heaven help her! How could she leave Eugene Mallard,
whom she loved better than life.</p>

<p>She crept up to her room, and during the long hours
of the night she fought the fiercest battle that woman
ever fought with herself. If she gave Royal Ainsley the
money he had asked for, he would certainly go away and
never cross her path again.</p>

<p>Her heart leaped at the thought. The thought that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
she was still bound to Royal Ainsley brought with it
the most poignant grief&mdash;a feeling of horror.</p>

<p>She did realize what it meant to live there beneath
that roof, even after she had found out the truth&mdash;that
she was not Eugene Mallard's wife.</p>

<p>What harm was there in living in the home of the
man she loved, seeing that they were so far apart in heart
as well as in purpose?</p>

<p>"No, I can not tear myself away from the only one I
have ever loved!" she cried. "If I were living here with
Eugene Mallard as his wife, then my duty would be plain&mdash;I
would have to leave here at once."</p>

<p>No, no! Come what might, she could not tear herself
away from Eugene Mallard.</p>

<p>In the drawer of her writing-desk lay a roll of bills
which Eugene had handed her the day before, to
purchase new furniture for her suite of rooms.</p>

<p>"Select it the first day you go to the city," he had said.</p>

<p>She had intended purchasing it the following week.</p>

<p>Now she went hurriedly to her desk, took out the roll
of bills, and counted them.</p>

<p>There was just a thousand dollars. She drew a great
sigh of relief. That would buy Royal Ainsley's eternal
silence. Before handing it to him, she would swear him
to secrecy forever.</p>

<p>She never knew how she lived through the next day.</p>

<p>There was not a moment that Royal Ainsley's handsome,
cruel, sneering face did not appear before her.</p>

<p>How she loathed him! She hated, with fierce, intense
hatred, the very sound of his name.</p>

<p>Night came at last.</p>

<p>The few guests that were stopping at the house were
assembled in the drawing-room, and it was not an easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
matter to find some convenient excuse to get away from
them.</p>

<p>But when the hands of the clock on the mantel pointed
to the hour of eight, she felt that she must get away.</p>

<p>Some one suggested playing a piece of music which she
had taken to her room the day before to study.</p>

<p>"I will go and search for it," she said; and with that
remark she glided from the room.</p>

<p>How dark the night was! She almost shivered as she
touched the graveled walk and hurried down to the brook-side.</p>

<p>When this night had passed away, a life-time of happiness
would lay before her. The wind moaned fitfully
among the trees, and the branches of the tall oaks swayed
to and fro. She heard the murmur of the brook before
she reached it, and as she drew near and became accustomed
to the dim light, she saw a tall man pacing up
and down.</p>

<p>He did not hear the light step on the grass. He was
muttering imprecations that made the girl's heart turn
cold with dread as she listened. Then he saw her.</p>

<p>"Ah! you have come!" he eagerly called out. "It is
well for you that you did," he continued, "for I had just
made up my mind to go to the house and ask for you."</p>

<p>In the dim light he saw her recoil. Although she made
no answer, he fancied he could almost hear the wild
throbbing of her heart.</p>

<p>"Did you bring the money?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered hoarsely; "but before I give
it to you, I shall exact a solemn promise that you will
never come near me again!"</p>

<p>"Certainly you shall have the promise&mdash;a dozen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
them if you like," he cried, forcing back an insolent
laugh.</p>

<p>"You must solemnly promise that you will never
come near me again if I give this money to you," she said.</p>

<p>"No," he answered; "I will never come near you. I
will go abroad. Does that satisfy you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered. "Only go so far away that I
shall never see your face again."</p>

<p>He closed his hand eagerly over the money, saying to
himself that it was a veritable gold mine that he had
found.</p>

<p>"Let me go!" she panted, as he put out his hand to
touch her.</p>

<p>With the swiftness of a startled deer, she fled past him
into the darkness of the grounds.</p>

<p>Royal Ainsley laughed harshly.</p>

<p>"This money will last me for a few weeks, my lady,"
he muttered, "and then&mdash;Ah! we shall see!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XLIX" id="CHAPTER_XLIX">CHAPTER XLIX.</a></h2>


<p>When Ida re-entered the house, the guests were still
assembled in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Eugene Mallard was standing a little apart from the
rest, looking thoughtfully into vacancy.</p>

<p>As she entered the room, he started, and, to her surprise,
he crossed over to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ida," he said, "will you come out on the porch with
me for a few moments? I wish to speak with you."</p>

<p>She looked at him in terror. Had he learned of the
return of Royal Ainsley?</p>

<p>A great darkness seemed to suddenly envelop her, and
it was by the greatest effort that she kept herself from
swooning. But the fresh air revived her.</p>

<p>Eugene placed a chair for her, and as she was trembling
violently, she was glad to sink into it. There was a
seat near. Eugene did not take it, but, instead, stood
leaning against one of the fluted columns of the porch.
For a few moments he was silent, and those few moments
seemed like long years to Ida.</p>

<p>"I have brought you out here to have an earnest talk
with you," he said, huskily. "The time has now come
when we should try to understand each other. Don't
you think so?"</p>

<p>She looked up at him in affright. Was he going to
send her away? Was he growing tired of the position
in which they stood to each other?</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered; and it caused her a desperate
effort to utter the word.</p>

<p>"I am going to take you into my confidence, Ida," he
said. "Come under this swinging lamp. I want to read
you this letter."</p>

<p>She followed him with faltering steps.</p>

<p>To her great surprise she saw him take from his
breast-pocket the very letter which Miss Fernly had sent,
and which she had slipped into his desk. But she dared
not tell him that she knew what the letter contained.</p>

<p>"I will preface my remarks by saying that the news
of your illness has spread far and wide, and that the
report was repeated in different forms. Instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
saying that you were ill, some of the papers had it that
my young wife had died. Miss Fernly, whom you have
good reason to remember, thereupon wrote me this
letter."</p>

<p>She listened, her face white as death. He handed her
the letter. Every word made a new wound in her heart.
How well she remembered each and every sentence!
Slowly she read the letter through. Then she folded and
handed it back to him.</p>

<p>"Ida," he said, "I have been trying to forget the past
as no man has ever tried before. All my time has been
given up to it. I have drawn a curtain over my past, and
shut out its brightness, its hopes, from my life. I have
pulled the roots of a beautiful budding plant from my
soul, and bid it grow there no more. I have tried to do
my duty by you, and now I have come to this conclusion&mdash;you
must help me bury the past. I have brought you
out here to ask you to be my wife in fact as well as in
name."</p>

<p>He did not tell her that during her illness he had discovered
the secret of her life&mdash;that she loved him with all
the passionate love of her nature, and that his indifference
was eating out her life.</p>

<p>Ever since he had been turning the matter over in his
mind, and asking himself what he should do, and at last
he was brought face to face with the truth&mdash;he had no
right to marry her unless he intended living with her.</p>

<p>So clearly had his duty become defined to him that the
path of the future was now plain before him. He must
forget his love for Hildegarde, and the only way to do
that was to ask the wife he had wedded to help him.</p>

<p>"I ask you this after much calm deliberation," he said,
slowly. "Be my wife in reality as well as in name, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
we may yet make good and useful lives out of what is left
of them!"</p>

<p>He heard a cry escape from her lips, but he could not
tell whether it was one of pleasure or pain.</p>

<p>"I do not ask you to give my answer at once, unless
you choose to do so," he said, gently.</p>

<p>He bent over her and took her hand. He was startled
at its icy coldness. He could feel that she trembled at
his touch.</p>

<p>"I have startled you," he said, gently. "I would advise
you to go to your room, instead of mingling with the
guests to-night. There you can reflect upon what you
wish to do. I will leave you here," he said. But before
he turned away, he involuntarily stooped down, and
kissed the white face raised so appealingly to his.</p>

<p>It was the first caress he had ever offered her, and
that kiss burned her face for long hours afterward. It
filled her to the very depth of her soul, to the very center
of her heart.</p>

<p>Like one stricken suddenly blind, Ida groped her way
to her room.</p>

<p>"Ah! if I could only die with the memory of that kiss
burning my lips!" she cried.</p>

<p>She was like one stunned. What she had longed for,
yearned for with all the intensity of her soul, was laid
at her feet at last. But it was too late.</p>

<p>His love was offered her now, when she dared not
claim it, dared not accept it.</p>

<p>Ida rose the next morning with a heavy heart. She
had slept the sleep of exhaustion.</p>

<p>Eugene was surprised when she came down to the
table, she looked so changed. There were heavy circles
under her eyes, as though she had been weeping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>He could not understand her. He was quite sure she
would meet him with a happy, blushing face and downcast
eyes. Ida would be glad when she could escape his
wondering eyes. An hour later she was standing at the
window of the morning-room, which opened out on the
terrace, her mind in a tumult, when she heard Eugene's
voice at the other end of the room. She knew instinctively
that he was looking for her. Only two days ago she
would have waited there for him&mdash;would have eagerly
sought the opportunity of a few words with him; but
now she hastily unfastened the long French window, and
fled out into the grounds.</p>

<p>Eugene saw the flutter of the white figure hurrying
down the terrace.</p>

<p>"She wishes to escape an encounter with me," he
thought; and he was puzzled.</p>

<p>Ida went to the further end of the garden, where the
tall rose-bushes hid her from human eyes. She sat down
upon a little rustic bench and tried to think. But her
brain grew confused.</p>

<p>Only a short time ago she had cried out to Heaven to
give her the love of Eugene Mallard. Now that it was
laid at her feet, what should she do?</p>

<p>"Heaven direct me," she cried out; "I am so sorely
tempted! I used to wonder what people meant when they
talked of the agony of death. Now I know."</p>

<p>She was frightened at the vehemence of her emotion;
the memory of that caress made her tremble. She
dreaded the moment when she should see Eugene alone
again, but, woman-like, hoped that it would be soon. Her
heart was awakened at last. The sun of love shone in
its glory upon her.</p>

<p>It had come to her, this woman's heritage, this dower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
of passion and sorrow, called love, changing the world
into a golden gleam.</p>

<p>How was she ever to calm the fever that burned in her
veins? Yes, she loved him. She who had never, until
she met Eugene Mallard, known what love meant; she,
so young, beautiful, made so essentially for love, and
yet whose life had been so joyless and hopeless, loved
at last.</p>

<p>Eugene Mallard noticed her avoidance of him during
the week that followed. She was trying to think out
the problem in her own mind. Dare she drink of the cup
of joy that he had pressed to her lips? In her simplicity,
Ida thought that she had done much in denying herself
a look at him.</p>

<p>If she had been the most accomplished of coquettes,
she could not have chosen a method more calculating to
awaken his interest than by avoiding him.</p>

<p>"She does not care for me as much as I thought," he
told himself; and, man-like, he felt a trifle piqued.</p>

<p>He had fancied that all he would have to do would be
to ask her, and she would come straight to his arms.</p>

<p>This was, indeed, a new phase of her character. Yet
he could not help but admire her maidenly modesty.</p>

<p>He would give her her own time to think over the
proposition that he had laid before her. He would not
seek her, would not intrude upon her. He looked at her
more during that day than he had during all the time she
had been under his roof.</p>

<p>He had not known before that she was so beautiful, so
sweet, so womanly. How careless he had been in letting
her go about by herself, a prey for such rascals as Arthur
Hollis!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Once he surprised her in the grounds. He had come
up to her very quietly.</p>

<p>"Ida," he said, "have you forgotten that you have not
so far answered the question I asked of you two weeks
ago on the porch? Tell me, when am I to claim my
wife?"</p>

<p>His wife! Great Heaven! Had she been mad, dreaming?
What had she been doing? What had she done?</p>

<p>His wife! She was Royal Ainsley's wife, and she
could not belong to any other man. She looked at him
with the pallor of despair in her face, the shadow of
death in her eyes.</p>

<p>What had she been doing to think of love in connection
with Eugene Mallard, when she was bound by the
heaviest of chains? The shock was terrible to her in
those few minutes, and the wonder is that it did not
kill her.</p>

<p>"I must have your answer here and now," Eugene
said, a trifle impatiently.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_L" id="CHAPTER_L">CHAPTER L.</a></h2>


<p>Eugene Mallard, looking down at the lovely, terrified
face, wondered what there could be to frighten her so.</p>

<p>He was intending to do a kind action. That she should
take the matter in this fashion rather surprised him.
He told himself that he could not understand women and
their ways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"My reason for coming to this conclusion," he said,
"is that I am intending to take a trip through the country,
and desire that you shall accompany me, Ida. We
could not go as we are now, and lead the same life as we
are living under this roof," he added, as she did not appear
to understand him. "You understand what I
mean?" he asked.</p>

<p>She answered "Yes," though he doubted very much if
she really did comprehend his words.</p>

<p>"That will be a fortnight from now. It will give you
plenty of time to think the matter over."</p>

<p>With these words he turned and left her.</p>

<p>She sank down into a garden-seat near by, her heart in
a tumult. The sheltered spot in which she sat was free
from observation. The tall, flowering branches screened
her.</p>

<p>During the days that followed, Eugene Mallard
watched Ida sharply. If the girl loved him as well as she
said she did, how strange it was that she was unwilling
to come to him.</p>

<p>One day, while they were at the breakfast-table, the
servant brought in the morning's mail.</p>

<p>"Here is a letter for you, Ida," said Eugene, handing
her a square white envelope.</p>

<p>One glance at it, and her soul seemed to turn sick
within her. It was from Royal Ainsley!</p>

<p>What had he to say to her? When he left her he
promised that she should never see his face again, that
he would never cross her path.</p>

<p>What did this communication mean?</p>

<p>Breakfast was over at last, and she hastened to the
morning-room, where she could read her letter without
being observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<span class="smcap">My little Wife.</span>&mdash;I am running in hard luck after
all. I invested all the money you were so generous as to
give me, and lost every cent of it. An open confession
is good for the soul. Having told you the truth, I feel
better. I will need just the same amount of money to
float me, and you must raise it for me somehow. I use
the word <i>must</i> to duly impress it upon you. I will be at
the same place where I met you last, on the evening of
the fourteenth. That will be just ten days from the time
you receive this letter. Do not fail me, Ida, or I might
be tempted to wreak vengeance upon my amiable cousin,
fascinating Eugene.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yours in haste, and with much love,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 45%;">"<span class="smcap">Royal</span>."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She flung the letter from her as though it were a scorpion.
A look of terror came over her face, her head
throbbed, and her brain whirled. Oh, Heaven! the torture
of it!</p>

<p>What if he kept this up? It would not be long before
she would be driven to madness.</p>

<p>"My little wife!" How the words galled her; they
almost seemed to take her life away.</p>

<p>"He will torture me to madness," she thought, with
the agony of despair.</p>

<p>How was she to raise the money to appease the man
who was her relentless foe?</p>

<p>Then she thought of her diamonds. Among the gifts
which she had received from Eugene was a diamond
necklace. This he had inherited from his uncle.</p>

<p>"The setting is very old," he had said, "because the
necklace has been worn by the ladies of our family for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
generations. The stones, however, are remarkably white
and brilliant. They are among the finest in this country,
and worth a fortune in themselves."</p>

<p>She had often looked at them as they lay in their rich
purple-velvet case.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I could raise the money on them," she thought,
with a little sob.</p>

<p>But she did not know it was to end in a tragedy.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_LI" id="CHAPTER_LI">CHAPTER LI.</a></h2>


<p>Ida no sooner found herself alone than she took from
her wardrobe a black dress, a long cloak, a bonnet and
black veil. She quickly donned them, then stole into
the corridor, locking the door after her, and putting the
key in her pocket.</p>

<p>If she could get out of the house and into the grounds
unobserved, all would be well. Fortune favored her; no
one was in sight.</p>

<p>She made her way to the railway station, and bought
a ticket for Washington. On the train was quite a number
of people whom she had met before. But they did
not recognize her with the veil pulled so closely over her
face.</p>

<p>The world seemed to stand still; but her heart seemed
to beat wildly, as she thought of it all.</p>

<p>At last Washington was reached, and for a minute she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
stood irresolute as she stepped upon the platform of the
depot. Then she timidly crossed over to where a policeman
stood.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I would like to be directed to a pawn-broker's
store, if&mdash;if you know where there is one," she said.</p>

<p>The guardian of the peace looked at her suspiciously.</p>

<p>It was a part of his business to believe all strangers
dishonest until he found them otherwise.</p>

<p>"Are you so much in need of money as to have to resort
to that?" he asked, taking in the stylish make and
fine texture of the clothes she wore.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, timidly.</p>

<p>The policeman pointed to a store a couple of blocks
further up, and Ida started for the place indicated, after
stopping to inquire when the train returned to where
she had come from.</p>

<p>He gave her the information, and watched her curiously
until she was out of sight.</p>

<p>"It is evident that she has come to Washington simply
for the purpose of pawning something. As soon as I
reach the other end of my beat I will make it my business
to step into Uncle Samuel's and ask what she has disposed
of. It is just as well for me to know."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ida hurried quickly on her errand.</p>

<p>The pawn-broker's clerk glanced up impatiently as
the door opened and the dark-clad figure glided in.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I should like to see the proprietor, to ask if he will
advance me a sum of money on some diamonds."</p>

<p>"Have you got them with you?" asked the man,
carelessly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ida, faintly; "but can't I see the proprietor?"</p>

<p>"You can deal with me just as well," he answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>After a moment's hesitation, Ida produced the package
from her pocket, and unwrapping it, disclosed the magnificent
diamonds.</p>

<p>A cry of surprise broke from the clerk's lips. In all
the years of his life he had never seen anything so grand
as the diamond necklace. But, like all shrewd men in
his calling, he carefully suppressed the cry of astonishment.</p>

<p>"How much do you want to realize on this?" he asked,
indifferently.</p>

<p>"One thousand dollars," said Ida, faintly.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!" he laughed. "That's pretty good,
when you know full well that you couldn't realize one-half
that sum on them."</p>

<p>"But I shall have to!" cried Ida.</p>

<p>The man closed his hand down over the lid.</p>

<p>"How did you come by these?" he asked.</p>

<p>He saw the slender figure shiver.</p>

<p>"You have no right to ask me anything like that,"
she replied.</p>

<p>"Probably not," returned the man; "still, when we
don't ask, we generally do a great deal of guessing. But
to end the matter, I will advance you a couple of hundred
on them."</p>

<p>"I must have a thousand dollars," repeated Ida. "If
it were not absolutely necessary for me to raise the
money on them, I should not have brought them here."</p>

<p>"Two hundred is a nice little sum," said the man. "If
you refuse to take that, I might take it into my head to
hold you on suspicion, and call in a policeman. Bear in
mind, I will give you that amount of money without
asking you where they came from. A policeman would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
want to know the whys and wherefores of the whole
thing."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I <i>must</i> raise a thousand dollars on them," she reiterated,
grasping the jewel-case.</p>

<p>The man's bluff had not worked.</p>

<p>"That's all <i>I'll</i> give; but father might accommodate
you with a little more," he added, touching a little bell.</p>

<p>The summons was instantly answered by a short, stout
little man who looked as if he had overheard the conversation.</p>

<p>A quick glance passed between them.</p>

<p>"Here is something for you to decide," went on the
young man. "This lady tells me that she wants a certain
amount for these diamonds."</p>

<p>"I must have a thousand dollars," interposed Ida,
"and if you can not advance me that amount, do not
detain me, please; I must look elsewhere."</p>

<p>Again the lid was thrown back, and the casket exposed
to the elder man's gaze. He fairly caught his breath as
the blazing jewels met his eye. A wolfish expression
leaped into his face.</p>

<p>"I think I can accommodate the lady," he said, blandly.
"My motto is to please the ladies even if I have to strain
a point to do so."</p>

<p>He placed his hand in his pocket and brought forth a
roll of bills.</p>

<p>"How will you have the money&mdash;in tens or twenties?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"It does not matter much," said Ida.</p>

<p>He handed her a roll of bills.</p>

<p>"You can count it, and see if the amount you wish is
there," he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>She counted it over with trembling hands. Yes, there
was just a thousand dollars there.</p>

<p>"You will take great care of the diamonds?" she
asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;certainly. They are as safe in my hands
as though they were in your own keeping, lady."</p>

<p>She put the money in her pocket, and hurried from
the place.</p>

<p>"Abraham! Abraham!" cried the old man, excitedly,
as soon as the street door had closed upon her, "our
fortune is made! This necklace is worth at least a cool
seventy-five thousand if it's worth a penny, and we have
got it in our possession for a paltry thousand dollars!"</p>

<p>"I knew the diamonds were very fine, and worth a
fortune," replied the young man; "but I did not know
they were worth as much as that. What do you intend
to do with them, father? You will have to give them up
to her if she claims them."</p>

<p>"Do you think I'm a fool!" exclaimed the elder man,
angrily. "She'll never lay eyes on those stones. Depend
on that!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_LII" id="CHAPTER_LII">CHAPTER LII.</a></h2>


<p>Ida hurried back to the depot, purchased her ticket,
and boarded the train for home.</p>

<p>She had scarcely stepped from the ticket-agent's window,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
ere the policeman who had directed her to the
pawn-shop accosted the agent.</p>

<p>"Where did that veiled woman buy her ticket for?
What is her destination?" he whispered.</p>

<p>He told him, and the officer jotted down the name of
the station in his note-book.</p>

<p>With the money securely in her possession, Ida reached
home. Dusk had crept up; the stars were out in the sky.</p>

<p>She succeeded in gaining her own room unobserved.
She was tired and hungry; indeed, she had not thought
of food since she had left the house early in the day.</p>

<p>She threw off the long black cloak, the bonnet, thick
veil, and black dress she had worn on her visit to Washington.
After bathing her face in fragrant water and
donning a silken house-robe, Ida rang the bell for her
maid.</p>

<p>"Nora," she said, "you may bring me a cup of tea
and a biscuit."</p>

<p>"I am very glad that you are awake at last," said
Nora. "I wanted very much to tell you something; but
as you bid me not to disturb you on any account, I dared
not come and knock on the door, ma'am."</p>

<p>"You are quite right," said Ida, wearily, "not to disturb
me. I needed rest&mdash;rest," said Ida, brokenly.</p>

<p>"I wanted to tell you about the man who was skulking
in the grounds. I was hurrying along here a few
moments ago, when some one sprung out from behind
the rose-bushes and grasped me by the arm.</p>

<p>"I certainly would have cried out with terror, but he
put his hand over my mouth.</p>

<p>"'Keep still, and I won't hurt you,' he said, with an
oath.</p>

<p>"Trembling with terror, I stood still. I saw that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
was a gentleman; but I noticed also that he was very
much under the influence of wine.</p>

<p>"'Tell me, are you one of the maids from the house?'
he asked.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' I answered.</p>

<p>"'Do you know me?' he questioned.</p>

<p>"'No,' I replied. 'I am a stranger in the village. I
have only been in my lady's employ a little more than a
fortnight.'</p>

<p>"'I want you to give your mistress <i>this</i>,' he said, producing
an envelope from his pocket."</p>

<p>She did not add that the stranger had given her a bill
to insure the safe delivery of his message, and to keep
her from saying anything about it.</p>

<p>As the girl spoke, she produced an envelope.</p>

<p>Even before the hapless Ida saw it, she knew full well
from whom it came.</p>

<p>Poor, hapless Ida! She sunk down into the nearest
seat, white as she would ever be in death. She did not
dare open it until after the girl had gone for the tea.</p>

<p>She drank it eagerly.</p>

<p>"Please bring me another cup, Nora," she said,
"stronger than the first."</p>

<p>"I am afraid that you have a fever, my lady," said the
girl, anxiously.</p>

<p>"I am only thirsty. You may as well take the biscuit
back; I am afraid it would choke me," said Ida.</p>

<p>"But you must be hungry," persisted the maid. "I
am sure you have eaten nothing since breakfast time."</p>

<p>When the girl had gone, Ida tore open the envelope,
and read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">"My clever little wife, I am here a day earlier than
I anticipated. Meet me at once in the same place. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
course you have the money by this time. Bring it with
you."</p></blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">She crushed the note in her hand. No one heard the
gasping, the bitter sob, the despairing cry she uttered.
The iron had entered her soul. There was nothing but
to obey his commands.</p>

<p>The girl had said that he was under the influence of
wine.</p>

<p>Ida had seen him in that condition once before, and
that was on his bridal-eve, and the memory of it had
never left her.</p>

<p>He was terrible enough when sober, but under the influence
of liquor he might be a fiend.</p>

<p>The girl brought a second cup of tea, which Ida drank
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Now, leave me, Nora," she said, "and do not come
again until I ring for you."</p>

<p>With trembling hands, Ida placed the money in her
bosom, drew the black cloak over her shoulders, and
hurried into the grounds.</p>

<p>Trembling with a vague apprehension, she sped by a
path that was seldom used down to the brook-side.</p>

<p>"True to your tryst!" said a well-known voice. "Fairest,
cleverest of women, how can I thank you enough
for your promptness?"</p>

<p>She stood still, cold as marble, her face ghastly white
in the flickering light of the stars.</p>

<p>"Have you no word for me?" he cried, with a harsh,
derisive laugh. "Have you no smile, no kiss, no kind
word? Have you nothing to say to me? You have no
love, no light of welcome in your eyes, and yet you loved
me so dearly once, my sweet Ida? Do you remember?
And now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"You mocking demon!" she panted, "how dare you
utter such words to me? I wonder you are not afraid
that Heaven will strike you dead where you stand!"</p>

<p>"Heaven strike me dead?" he repeated. "What a
horrible idea! Afraid? Oh, no, my dear. You are the
first charming creature I ever saw who flew into such a
rage because her husband was pleased to be sentimental
to her."</p>

<p>He heard her draw her breath hard. She stood before
him white and trembling, her eyes filled with burning
fire.</p>

<p>"Say, Ida, couldn't you manage somehow to get the
rest of the money&mdash;the five thousand?"</p>

<p>"No!" she answered, pitifully.</p>

<p>"That's only a bluff," he cried. "But it won't work
with me!"</p>

<p>"You have sworn eternal silence <i>now</i>!" she cried;
"you have given your oath, and you dare not break it.
I can not raise any more money!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will pay that amount for a little secret
which I possess, my lady," he said, mockingly.</p>

<p>"There is nothing more you could tell me that would
interest me."</p>

<p>"We shall see," he replied, sneeringly.</p>

<p>He pulled from under his coat a dark-lantern, shot
back the slide, and a flood of light illumined the scene.
He drew a package from his pocket and unwrapped it.
Ida watched him like one in a dream.</p>

<p>Suddenly an awful cry broke from her lips. One by
one he took from the package the articles of clothing that
had been worn by the little child he had secured from the
village merchant's wife.</p>

<p>A cry awful to hear broke from her lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose, Ida, it isn't the proper thing to keep a
person in suspense," he cried. "You deserted your little
child&mdash;never once sought to discover whether it were
dead or alive. By the merest chance, I ran across it
lately. I took possession of it, and I have it now."</p>

<p>"I can not, I will not believe you," she answered,
quickly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps this will convince you," he said, reading
aloud a letter from the superintendent of the foundling
asylum where the child had been placed.</p>

<p>It gave a full account of all that could be ascertained
of the hapless mother of the child. As he read by the
light of the dark-lantern, she knew that it was all true.</p>

<p>Her child alive!</p>

<p>The rapture of the thought was drowned in the horror
that it was in this man's possession.</p>

<p>She fell on her face in the long grass, mad with misery
and despair.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_LIII" id="CHAPTER_LIII">CHAPTER LIII.</a></h2>


<p>For a moment it seemed as though the darkness of
death had come over Ida.</p>

<p>"My revelation surprises you," Royal Ainsley said,
with a most horrible laugh.</p>

<p>The laugh and the words recalled her to her senses.
She sprung to her feet and faced him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is my child?" she cried, wildly. "Speak, for
the love of Heaven, I pray you."</p>

<p>"It will cost you just another thousand dollars to find
that out. Bring me that amount here to-morrow night at
the same hour, and I will give you full information.
Isn't that fair enough?"</p>

<p>Pleadings and prayers were alike unavailing.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose I am going to tell you for nothing,
when I can make you pay handsomely?"</p>

<p>"But I haven't the money," she sobbed, "and&mdash;and
you know it!"</p>

<p>"How did you get this thousand?" he asked.</p>

<p>Then Ida told him all.</p>

<p>"You were a fool to get rid of the diamonds before
you had asked Eugene Mallard for the money and been
refused. Go to him and ask him for the money now.
He does not know how to refuse a woman, and he will
give it to you."</p>

<p>"And if I refuse?" she asked, desperately.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Then you and the man you love will be thrown into
prison," Royal declared, "to serve a term of fifteen or
twenty years. After that you can not complain as to how
I brought up your daughter, if she follows in the footsteps
of her mother!"</p>

<p>He could not have used a more conclusive argument.</p>

<p>"Have you no heart, man&mdash;no mercy?" cried Ida.</p>

<p>"Come, come, I say, do not be theatrical; the role does
not become you! Better be sensible, and consider the
proposition I make you."</p>

<p>"I will leave you now," he said; "but I will be here,
at this same hour, to-morrow night."</p>

<p>"No, no!" she cried. "Give me a week to think it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
over, and&mdash;and to see what I can do about raising the
money."</p>

<p>"Well, then, a week, if you must have it," he replied;
"but no longer. Here, you can take these proofs of my
story regarding your child and look them over at your
leisure," he said, thrusting the package into her hand.</p>

<p>The next moment he was gone. She did not faint;
she knew that if she did she would be found there with
the package in her hand. She was so dazed, so bewildered,
she never remembered how she reached the house
and her own room. Again she rang the bell for Nora.</p>

<p>"You may bring me another cup of tea," she said,
faintly, "as strong as the last one."</p>

<p>The girl, noticing how pale and ill her mistress looked,
thought it would be best to bring her a glass of wine as
well.</p>

<p>"Unless I am very much mistaken, she has a sick spell
coming on. Her face is pale, but every now and then it
flushes burning red."</p>

<p>Ida did not seek her couch that night until she had
eagerly scanned every article of clothing the parcel contained.</p>

<p>Her excitement knew no bounds as she read the letter
from the superintendent of the foundling asylum, concerning
all that he knew of the baby's parentage, in which
he stated that the doctor who had attended the young
mother had brought the child to the institution in a dying
condition, as he supposed, and was hastily called abroad,
and had barely time to make the outgoing steamer. He
had told them that they could tell the hapless young
mother when she was able to bear the sad news.</p>

<p>Ida wept as she had never wept before as she read
those written words, and her excitement increased as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
saw that the letter was directed to the village merchant's
wife, Mrs. Lester, who had taken the child.</p>

<p>It was, then, her own child that she had clasped in
her arms, the eyes of her own babe into which she had
gazed with such agony and yet with such rapture.</p>

<p>Then another fear seized her. She had not seen the
little one for weeks.</p>

<p>Was it ill? Had anything happened to it? She could
not visit Mrs. Lester's home until the day broke.</p>

<p>How came her little child in the possession of Royal
Ainsley?</p>

<p>The suspense which she endured almost drove her insane.
The next morning she was up as early as the
servants were.</p>

<p>"Joe," she said to the old coachman, "I want you to
harness up the swiftest horses you have in the stable,
and take me to the village. I want to go to the store
kept by the Lesters."</p>

<p>"You will not find it open so early in the mornin',
ma'am," declared Joe. "Dem village folk am pow'ful
lazy."</p>

<p>"We will go to their garden, and perhaps be fortunate
enough to find them there," said Ida, eagerly. "Harness
the horses at once, Joe."</p>

<p>The hapless young mother scarcely breathed during
that ride.</p>

<p>After what seemed to her almost an endless ride, they
drew up before the village store kept by the Lesters.</p>

<p>As Joe had predicted, the door was closed, and the
blinds drawn.</p>

<p>"There they are in the garden yonder; at least, there
am Mrs. Lester in the strawberry-patch, and there am
her husband, off further in the fields."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will go to her," said Ida, stepping quickly from the
carriage.</p>

<p>So busy was Mrs. Lester with her task of gathering
the ripe fruit, that she did not know of the presence of
her visitor until she stood beside her.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lester," said a quick, eager, husky voice, "I do
hope I have not surprised you this morning."</p>

<p>"Well, well, you have surprised me, for a fact. I
suppose you want to get something from the store."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do, but not just now," returned Ida, with
feverish impatience. "Let me sit down here a few moments
and talk with you."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said the woman; "but I haven't anything
out here to invite you to sit upon, save that little
garden-seat which I always take around with me, so
that I can rest myself when I get tired."</p>

<p>"It will do very well, thank you," said Ida, feeling so
weak and faint that she could hardly stand.</p>

<p>"I have not seen you nor your little child lately,"
began Ida.</p>

<p>Then she stopped short, lest her quivering voice should
betray her terrible anxiety.</p>

<p>"No," returned Mrs. Lester. "I no longer have the
little one, bless its poor, dear little heart!"</p>

<p>"Has anything happened to it?" asked Ida, the agony
of death in her voice. "Oh, tell me, where is it? Is
the little baby dead?"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_LIV" id="CHAPTER_LIV">CHAPTER LIV.</a></h2>


<p>It seemed to Ida that it took ages for the woman to
reply. She leaned forward breathlessly, fairly devouring
her with her dark, dilated eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! the baby did not die," said Mrs. Lester, "although
it was a weak, puny little thing.</p>

<p>"I'll just tell you all about it, for I feel just like talking
it over with some one.</p>

<p>"The child required so much care that my husband
decided we could not keep it, and I was on my way to
take it back to the foundling asylum in New York, when
the strangest thing happened.</p>

<p>"In the depot I met a young man who used to live in
the village. His name is Royal Ainsley."</p>

<p>"Yes! yes!" interposed Ida, faintly, feeling almost
more dead than alive.</p>

<p>"I was telling him all about the baby, showing him the
letters that came with it, and the proofs I had of its
identity, when he suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>"'I will tell you in a few words what I'll do. I'll take
this little one back to New York, and save you the trip!'</p>

<p>"He offered me one hundred dollars to give him the
child then and there. We are very poor, Mrs. Mallard,
and a hundred dollars seemed a fortune to me.</p>

<p>"It's over a fortnight since that occurred, but I have
not ceased to worry about it, I assure you."</p>

<p>Young Mrs. Mallard suddenly staggered to her feet
and turned away.</p>

<p>"I think I will not wait any longer," said Ida, in a
strangely altered voice. "Good-morning, Mrs. Lester!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>The next moment she hurried down the garden-path,
and entered her carriage.</p>

<p>Like one wild with terror, Ida hurried back to the carriage
and re-entered it.</p>

<p>"Home!" she said; and old Joe was surprised at the
sound of her voice, it was so unnatural.</p>

<p>"What Royal Ainsley told me is indeed too true!"
she said to herself, with an inward moan. "He has possession
of my little child. Only Heaven knows how he
will use his power to crush me, and the fair, sweet, innocent
babe as well!"</p>

<p>It seemed to her as though the very thought of it would
drive her mad. She knew she was in his power, and that
he would certainly use that power to extort every dollar
from her that he possibly could. And then, when there
was no more money to be gained, what would he do?</p>

<p>She avoided Eugene Mallard during the next few
days, lest he should repeat the question he had asked
when he last talked with her.</p>

<p>He watched her in wonder. Her apparent coyness
amused as well as surprised him.</p>

<p>"There is no way of understanding women," he said
to himself. "To-day they are eager for something; to-morrow
they will not have it!"</p>

<p>He was surprised when he received a message from
her one day, asking him if she could see him alone in
the library.</p>

<p>He sent back a reply in the affirmative, and awaited
her coming with some curiosity, no doubt entering his
mind as to what she wished to say.</p>

<p>It was some time before she put in an appearance. He
was not aware of her presence, he was gazing so intently
out of the window, until she stood by his side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Mallard," she began, hesitatingly, "please pardon
me for intruding upon you; but I could not wait."</p>

<p>He looked down wonderingly at the lovely young face
so strangely pale.</p>

<p>"Would it not be as well for my wife to address me
as Eugene?" he asked, with a grave smile.</p>

<p>She looked up at him and tried to utter the word; but
somehow it seemed as though she could not.</p>

<p>My wife!</p>

<p>How those words cut her! If they had been the
sharp thrust of a sword, they could not have cut her
deeper.</p>

<p>His wife!</p>

<p>She would have given everything in this world if indeed
it were true that she was Eugene Mallard's wife.</p>

<p>Another face rose before her vision&mdash;a fair, handsome,
sneering face&mdash;and she drew back with a shudder.</p>

<p>He noticed it, and the kindly words he was about to
utter were hushed on his lips.</p>

<p>After placing a chair for her, and taking one near it,
he waited for her to proceed.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I have come to ask your indulgence in a little
matter," she said, faintly.</p>

<p>"Yes?" he said, kindly.</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence between them&mdash;a
deep, painful, awkward silence, which was broken at
length by Ida.</p>

<p>"I have been looking over some furniture," she said,
tremulously, "and&mdash;and I could use just double the
amount of money you gave me. Would you be very,
very angry if I asked you for a thousand dollars more?"</p>

<p>He threw back his head and laughed outright.</p>

<p>"One would think, by the manner in which you express<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
yourself, that you were suing for some great favor, the
granting of which you doubted."</p>

<p>She looked at him with dilated eyes, the color coming
and going in her face.</p>

<p>She could not understand, by his remark, whether or
not he intended giving it to her.</p>

<p>He turned at once to his desk, saying:</p>

<p>"I will write out a check for the amount you wish."</p>

<p>"No; not a check, please," she answered, piteously.
"I would so much rather have the money."</p>

<p>He looked surprised.</p>

<p>"I haven't the amount you wish," he said. "I have
not half that amount probably. I always use checks in
preference to carrying money about with me."</p>

<p>He was quite mystified at the look of terror that crept
into her eyes.</p>

<p>"I must have it in cash," she said, imploringly.
"Could you not get it for me somehow?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;certainly," he replied. "When will you want
it?"</p>

<p>"To-night," she answered, piteously.</p>

<p>"You shall have it," he answered.</p>

<p>But there flashed through his mind a suspicion he
would have given anything to have removed.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_LV" id="CHAPTER_LV">CHAPTER LV.</a></h2>


<p>Eugene Mallard thought long and earnestly after Ida
had left him: "What can Ida want with the cash, and
in so short a time?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>He put on his hat, went round to the stables, and ordered
his horse. A canter over the hills would drive
away these gloomy, unhappy thoughts.</p>

<p>The sun had crept to its zenith, and was now sinking
toward the west as he reined his horse before the little
village inn at Hampton Corners.</p>

<p>Every one knew Eugene Mallard. The proprietor of
the hotel on the old Virginia turnpike road warmly welcomed
him. He had concluded to rest a little and refresh
his horse.</p>

<p>As he lighted his cigar and sat down on the porch, the
first person he saw was Dora Staples.</p>

<p>"I am really so delighted to see you, Mr. Mallard,"
she said in her pretty lisping accent.</p>

<p>"I had not expected to see you before the fourteenth.
We have not had an acknowledgment of the invitation
to our ball which we sent you and your wife a week ago;
but I feel sure you won't disappoint us. We count upon
you two as our most particular guests."</p>

<p>Eugene flushed hotly.</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly," he said. "I hope you will pardon
my not answering your kind favor at once. I will see
that my wife writes you and accepts the invitation."</p>

<p>"By the way," went on Dora. "I saw Mr. Hollis only
yesterday. We went to Richmond to do some shopping,
and the first person I met was Mr. Hollis. I am sure
he tried to avoid me, though he says he didn't. I told
him about the ball, as I did not know where to send the
invitation to him. I told him that you and Mrs. Mallard
would be there, and that all we now needed to make the
affair as pleasant as the one at your house was his
presence.</p>

<p>"'I will come if I can,' he said; 'but don't feel hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
toward me if I should fail to be there. I have a matter
of considerable importance on hand for that date, and I
do not know just how I will be able to arrange it.'"</p>

<p>Eugene Mallard drove slowly homeward. Although
he tried to banish Dora's words from his mind, yet they
still haunted him.</p>

<p>What was Arthur Hollis doing in Richmond? He
was more puzzled over it than he cared to own.</p>

<p>As he rode up to the door, he saw Ida on the veranda,
talking to a group of friends. It then struck him as it
had never struck him before that his young wife was very
handsome; and he was beginning to wonder how it was
that he had been so blind as to not see that which was
attracting the attention of every one else.</p>

<p>She wore a tight-fitting dress of pale-blue silk, with a
crimson rose in its bodice. She held a bunch of roses
in her white hand. There were several other ladies
present, but not one of them could compare with her.</p>

<p>For the first time since his marriage a feeling of exultation
stole into his heart at the thought that this peerless
creature belonged solely to him.</p>

<p>They were speaking of the grand ball the Staples's
were to give, and commenting on what they were going
to wear.</p>

<p>"How about <i>you</i>, Mrs. Mallard? What are <i>you</i> going
to wear? Don't keep what you are going to wear a
secret, and then spring some wonderful creation upon our
wondering gaze."</p>

<p>"I assure you," said Ida, "that I have no intention of
doing anything of the kind. Indeed," she declared, earnestly,
"in sending out the invitations, I am <i>sure</i> they have
forgotten us!"</p>

<p>At this juncture, Eugene stepped forward, saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is there any excuse a man can offer for forgetting
so great a favor as an invitation to a grand ball? That
is exactly what has occurred. I received the invitation
for the Staples's ball one day last week. I should have
taken it direct to my wife, but you know that 'procrastination
is the thief of time.' It has proved so in this case.
I laid it down, and in the press of other matters, I forgot
it. My papers must have covered it, and the matter entirely
escaped my mind until to-day."</p>

<p>"Of course you will go?" remarked the ladies in
chorus.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; we are sure to do so," he responded.</p>

<p>A little later he found Ida alone in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"I do hope you will look your best at this particular
ball," he said. "The governor of the State; in fact, any
number of my old friends will be there. I want you to
wear your most becoming dress, and all the family diamonds."</p>

<p>Ida had been looking down calmly at the roses she held.
But as mention of the diamonds fell from her husband's
lips, a change that was alarming came over her face.</p>

<p>She grew white as death; her eyes lost their light. The
roses which she held fell to her feet.</p>

<p>"Why, Ida, you look as if it were an occasion for sorrow
instead of one of joy," Eugene remarked.</p>

<p>"What is the date of the ball?" she asked.</p>

<p>"The fourteenth," he responded.</p>

<p>Again that ashen pallor spread over her face, leaving it
white to the lips.</p>

<p>That was the date upon which Royal Ainsley was to
bring her child to her.</p>

<p>What was the great ball to her compared with this
event?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>While in the village Eugene had got the money she
had asked of him. He had handed it to her inclosed in
an envelope.</p>

<p>Oh, how kind and good he was to her! How very despicable
it was to deceive him! But what could she do?
Fate was against her.</p>

<p>Eugene could not help but notice the intense excitement
under which she labored during the time that
elapsed to the coming of the ball. She longed, yet
dreaded to have the day arrive.</p>

<p>The day came at last, bright and clear. There was
no cloud in the blue sky; the sun shone brightly in the
heavens. She was glad that there were several guests
at the house, as her husband would not have much opportunity
of observing her.</p>

<p>How that day passed she never knew. One moment
she was as white as death, the next she flushed as red
as a rose.</p>

<p>"Heaven help me to live over the excitement of to-day!"
she murmured, clasping her hands tightly.</p>

<p>She prayed for the noonday to linger. But time, which
stays at no man's bidding, rolled on. The sun went down
in a sweep of crimson glory; dusk gathered and deepened
into the darkness of night.</p>

<p>Seven o'clock sounded from the pearl-and-gold clock
on the mantel. Seven o'clock resounded from the great
brass-throated clock in the main hall.</p>

<p>"Nora," said Ida to her maid, "go down to the library
and tell Mr. Mallard that I am indisposed and can not
go with him to the ball, but that I earnestly pray he will
go without me, and enjoy himself. Say that I wish particularly
that he should go; and notice what he says,
Nora, and come back and tell me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>It seemed to Ida that Nora would never deliver the
message.</p>

<p>Why did she linger? At last the girl returned.</p>

<p>"What did he say, Nora?" she asked, breathlessly,
fixing her startled eyes eagerly on the girl's face.</p>

<p>"He made no reply, ma'am," returned Nora; "but I
am sure he will go, since you so earnestly requested it."</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_LVI" id="CHAPTER_LVI">CHAPTER LVI.</a></h2>


<p>It was with the greatest surprise that Eugene Mallard
received the message that Nora delivered&mdash;that Ida was
too ill to attend the grand ball with him.</p>

<p>"She did not seem to be ill this afternoon," he said
to himself.</p>

<p>Obeying a sudden impulse, he hurried from the room,
intent upon going to Ida's <i>boudoir</i> and offering her his
sympathy; but, on second thought, he concluded that in
all probability she would not care to be disturbed.</p>

<p>He felt grievously disappointed. He knew that many
of his friends would be present; and besides, what could
he say to Mrs. Staples and her daughters?</p>

<p>Some of her friends had left Ida apparently in the best
of health and spirits at noon. How could he account to
them for her sudden indisposition?</p>

<p>During the forenoon he saw that there was something
on Ida's mind; that she was greatly troubled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps the words he had said to her only a short
time before had much to do with her indisposition. He
felt that he ought to have a talk with Ida. If he were
to reassure her that she could have everything her own
way, she might feel much relieved.</p>

<p>A second time he started for her <i>boudoir</i>; but again he
drew back. He could not tell what prompted him to
do so.</p>

<p>"Such strange, contradictory emotions seem to possess
me," he said. "I will go out into the grounds and
smoke a cigar. That will quiet me a little, and afterward
I will have a talk with Ida."</p>

<p>Eugene Mallard wandered about the grounds for half
an hour or more. He heard a clock strike the hour of
eight.</p>

<p>How dark and gloomy it was! There was no moon,
but the stars shed a faint, glimmering light.</p>

<p>He had smoked a cigar; but still he paced aimlessly up
and down the grounds, lost in thought.</p>

<p>He came to one of the garden benches. It looked so
inviting that he threw himself down upon it.</p>

<p>How long he sat there he never knew. Presently he
was disturbed by the sound of slow, cautious footsteps.
It could not be one of the servants stealing through the
grounds in that manner. It must be some poacher.</p>

<p>He drew back into the shadow of the trees, and
watched with no little curiosity. He had been so kind to
the villagers that he felt surprised at this apparent ingratitude.</p>

<p>Presently a figure came down the path. The more he
watched the figure the more certain he became that he
had seen it before. Its every move seemed familiar
to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly a thought flashed into his mind that made
him hold his breath.</p>

<p>"Great Heavens! can it be Arthur Hollis?" he ejaculated.</p>

<p>His face paled; great flashes of fire seemed to come
from his eyes. The very blood in his veins seemed to
stagnate. Faint and dizzy, he leaned back against the
trunk of a tree.</p>

<p>Great God! what could it mean? His wife supposed
him to be by this time on his way to the ball. During
his absence would she meet, dared she meet Arthur
Hollis?</p>

<p>The tall, familiar-looking figure paced impatiently by
the brook-side under the dim light of the stars. Yes, the
man was there waiting for some one.</p>

<p>From where he stood he could plainly see a faint light
in the window of his wife's room, and as his eyes were
fixed upon it, the light was extinguished.</p>

<p>If a sword had been plunged into Eugene Mallard's
heart, it could not have given him a greater shock.</p>

<p>Many a night he had paced up and down the grounds,
watching the light in that window. Then it had never
been put out before ten. Why should it be extinguished
so early to-night?</p>

<p>The thought troubled Eugene Mallard, as he turned
his head and saw the figure still pacing restlessly up and
down by the brook.</p>

<p>He dared not utter a word. He would await developments.
He scarcely breathed, in his suspense. It seemed
to him that the blood in his veins was turned to ice.</p>

<p>He took up a position where there was no possible
danger of being observed, and there he watched and
waited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>Up in her <i>boudoir</i> Ida was donning with trembling
hands, the long cloak that was to disguise her.</p>

<p>She had sent Nora from her room. But it seemed to
her that the girl looked back suspiciously as she went out
and closed the door after her.</p>

<p>"Heaven help me to get through with this exciting
scene!" Ida muttered.</p>

<p>Her heart was throbbing so, her limbs were so weak,
that she was obliged to sit down for a minute.</p>

<p>"Oh, Heaven help me! How thankful I am that Eugene
did not send for me before he left for the ball. He
has reached there by this time!" she muttered.</p>

<p>She looked at the clock, and said to herself that time
was flying, and she must hasten to keep her appointment.</p>

<p>Again she counted over the money which Eugene had
given her&mdash;the money that was to restore her little child
to her&mdash;the money that was to purchase her freedom and
end forever Royal Ainsley's persecutions.</p>

<p>"What would Eugene say if he knew all?" she asked
herself, in great trepidation.</p>

<p>She trembled even at the thought of it.</p>

<p>Was she doing right in concealing the truth from Eugene
Mallard?</p>

<p>She sprung from her chair and paced hurriedly up and
down the room.</p>

<p>If Eugene knew all, he would certainly tell her that her
path lay with Royal Ainsley, that his roof would shelter
her no more. And now she could not part from him.
Every fiber of her heart was woven about him.</p>

<p>She tried to look into the future; but, think what she
would, the pictures presented frightened her.</p>

<p>Presently she paused before the window. Was it only
her fancy, or did she hear the patter of rain-drops?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>She turned out the light and threw open the window.
She felt relieved to find that it was only the leaves that
were tapping against the window-pane. She closed the
window, with a sigh, and opened the door softly.</p>

<p>The corridor was empty; the gas-jets of the great chandelier
were turned low. Like a thief in the night, she
stole noiselessly down the winding passageway.</p>

<p>The sound of laughter from the servants' hall below
floated up to her through the awful stillness.</p>

<p>What if one of the doors on either side should open,
and some one step out and confront her?</p>

<p>She drew her long cloak closely about her, and pulled
the hood down over her head.</p>

<p>There was a side door opening on to a porch, and
leading directly into the grounds.</p>

<p>Ida hurried toward this door and opened it cautiously.
For a moment she stood on the threshold, and in that moment
a gust of wind blew the cloak from about her shoulders,
and it fell at her feet.</p>

<p>The light from the hall lamp clearly revealed her form
to Eugene Mallard, who stood leaning against an oak-tree
scarcely one hundred feet distant.</p>

<p>"It is Ida!" he muttered, hoarsely.</p>

<p>She turned her steps down toward the brook, as he
had feared she would do.</p>

<p>"She stayed away from the ball to meet that scoundrel!"
he muttered under his breath.</p>

<p>With hesitating steps, little dreaming of what the end
of her adventure would be, Ida hurried on to her doom.</p>

<p>The wind sighed a mournful requiem in the trees, the
songs of the birds were hushed, and the sweet murmur
of the brook seemed to end in a sob as it rushed onward
to the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>The night was warm, but a great shiver crept over Ida
as she turned out of the path and hurried along through
the garden by a short cut to the place where she knew
Royal Ainsley was impatiently waiting for her.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_LVII" id="CHAPTER_LVII">CHAPTER LVII.</a></h2>


<p>Royal Ainsley was not a man to be trusted when under
the influence of drink. As the minutes went by, and Ida
did not come, he was beside himself with rage.</p>

<p>"What does she mean by keeping me waiting in this
manner?" he roared. "By the Lord Harry, I'll make
her pay for this!"</p>

<p>Then, like Eugene Mallard, who was watching but a
few feet from him, he saw the light go out in Ida's room.</p>

<p>"That must be <i>her</i> room. She is coming at last," he
murmured.</p>

<p>He braced himself against the trunk of a tree, for by
this time his limbs were none too steady under him.</p>

<p>When the door opened, and he saw Ida approach, an
exclamation of satisfaction broke from his lips.</p>

<p>He sat down upon the mossy rock and watched the
slim figure as it moved slowly over the greensward.</p>

<p>"She is certainly in no hurry to see me," he muttered,
with a grim smile. "But I'll change all that."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ida had stopped short, and was standing
motionless in the path.</p>

<p>Putting her hand into the pocket of her dress, the
girl found, to her great amazement, that she had come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
away without the roll of bills she had intended to bring
with her. In her excitement she had left the money
on the table.</p>

<p>What should she do? There was no course to pursue
but go back for it.</p>

<p>Then a superstitious terror for which she could not
account seemed to seize her.</p>

<p>"It will surely be a bad omen to return to the house."
she told herself; "and yet I dare not meet Royal Ainsley
without the money. He will say that my story about forgetting
the money is only an excuse."</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_LVIII" id="CHAPTER_LVIII">CHAPTER LVIII.</a></h2>


<p>As Ida paused for a moment, wondering what course
would be best to pursue, she concluded that her only
course would be to return to the house for the money.</p>

<p>She had scarcely turned, before a piercing cry sounded
through the grounds, coming from the direction of the
brook.</p>

<p>Ida, terrified, stood for a moment rooted to the spot.
She tried to fly, but if her life had depended upon it, she
could not have stirred hand or foot.</p>

<p>She distinctly heard the sound of voices. Still, all
power to fly seemed to have left her.</p>

<p>What could it be? Had some of the servants discovered
Royal Ainsley's presence?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>She tried to think, but she was powerless. Every
sound seemed confusing.</p>

<p>Guided by the light, Nora had dashed quickly down
toward the brook. But ere she could reach the figure
pacing up and down so impatiently, she was seized
from behind by a pair of strong arms, a white angry
face bent over her, and a voice, which she instantly recognized
as her master's, cried harshly:</p>

<p>"Let me understand what this means!"</p>

<p>The girl was too frightened to speak.</p>

<p>"This is why you would not come to the ball, is it?"
he cried, excitedly, dragging her toward the spot where
her lover stood. "Come, you and I will confront the
lover whom you stayed away from the ball to meet here!"</p>

<p>Royal Ainsley took in the situation at once. He recognized
Eugene's voice.</p>

<p>"He has discovered Ida Mallard's appointment with
me in some way," he thought. And the knowledge terrified
him, coward as he was.</p>

<p>He turned and beat a hasty retreat, dodging directly
into the arms of old Joe.</p>

<p>"Ha! I've caught you <i>this</i> time!" cried the old servitor.</p>

<p>With an oath, Royal Ainsley flung Joe from him.</p>

<p>"Out of my way!" he cried, fiercely, "or I'll kill
you!"</p>

<p>The voice, as well as the words, startled old Joe, and
threw him entirely off his guard for an instant. In that
instant a heavy blow was dealt him which caused him to
loosen his hold on the intruder.</p>

<p>Then Royal Ainsley sped like a deer through the
grounds, every foot of which he knew well, and was
quickly lost to sight in the darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>After that first sharp cry, Nora regained something
of her natural bravado.</p>

<p>In less time than it takes to tell it, her master had
dragged her toward the house and under the full light of
the swinging lamp.</p>

<p>"Oh, master!" she cried, gaining her breath at last
"It's I, Nora, the maid!"</p>

<p>Eugene Mallard's tightly clinched hands fell from her;
he stared aghast at the girl.</p>

<p>"You, Nora!" he cried, in the greatest amazement,
with a world of relief and thankfulness blended in
his voice.</p>

<p>"Pray for&mdash;forgive me, Mr. Mallard," sobbed the girl.
"I&mdash;I did not do any intentional wrong. I was only
going down to the old south gate to meet my lover, sir.
I&mdash;I did not think for a moment that any one would
mind. My lady did not need me for an hour or more.
Oh, please forgive me if my action has displeased you!"</p>

<p>"It was your lover that you were going to meet?" repeated
Eugene Mallard, as if to satisfy himself that he
had heard aright.</p>

<p>He drew back and looked at Nora with fixed intentness,
the color that had left his face surging back to it again.</p>

<p>Eugene Mallard now walked to his library, and flung
himself down to think over the situation.</p>

<p>He felt grateful beyond words that matters were no
worse. He was ashamed of the thought that for a moment
had found lodgment in his brain against the wife
whom he had wedded.</p>

<p>Then it came to him&mdash;his love for Ida, whom he knew
now that he worshipped with all the passionate love of his
heart. How different it was from the love he had borne
Hildegarde Cramer!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>He wondered that he had been so blind as not to have
noticed his love for her sooner. He could scarcely wait
until the day dawned, that he might go to her and tell
her of the great love for her that was consuming his soul.</p>

<p>He said to himself that it was only her innate modesty
that caused her to hold aloof from him of late, and to
make her hesitate about giving him her answer.</p>

<p>He looked shudderingly backward over the past for
the last time. Yes, he would urge her to give him his
answer on the morrow. It never once occurred to him
but that her answer would be "Yes."</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_LIX" id="CHAPTER_LIX">CHAPTER LIX.</a></h2>


<p>When Royal Ainsley shook himself free from old Joe's
detaining grasp, his first impulse was to get as far away
from the place as possible.</p>

<p>With second thoughts, however, came another decision.
No; he must learn all that was taking place.</p>

<p>Quickly circling the grounds, he soon gained a vantage-place
behind a group of bushes not far from the house.
There he could easily see and hear all that transpired
without being seen himself.</p>

<p>He saw Eugene Mallard as he drew the girl beneath
the swinging lamp in the hall, and heard the conversation
that passed between them.</p>

<p>"So!" he muttered, grinding his white teeth savagely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
"the girl is my lady's maid, eh? I dare say, she sent
her with some message to me when she was intercepted
by Eugene Mallard. But Ida will find that this will not
work with me. See her I shall, if I have to stay in these
grounds till broad daylight."</p>

<p>He watched and waited until he saw even old Joe relax
his vigilance and go into the house.</p>

<p>Royal Ainsley waited there until the old mansion was
wrapped in gloom and darkness, then he slipped from his
hiding-place, passed noiselessly over the graveled walk,
and stood beneath Ida's window.</p>

<p>Stooping, he caught up a handful of pebbles. One
by one he flung them up against the window-pane. Just
as he had expected, he saw a white, terrified face appear
at the window, and two white hands threw up the sash.</p>

<p>He saw at once that it was Ida. He moved out from
the shadow of the trees. She saw him at once, and
recognized him.</p>

<p>"Is it <i>you</i>?" she cried, in the greatest alarm. "What
in Heaven's name are you doing there, pray?"</p>

<p>"Your common sense ought to tell you <i>that</i>;" he retorted,
harshly. "Come down here at once, I tell you,
and be sure to bring that money with you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! no! I can not!" she answered him, piteously.</p>

<p>"Why?" he demanded, with something very much like
an imprecation upon his lips.</p>

<p>"I dropped the money in the dining-room as I was
passing through it to get out into the grounds. The
room is locked; I can not get it until to-morrow morning.
Old Joe always carries the key with him."</p>

<p>"It is a lie!" he cried, fiercely.</p>

<p>"No! no! On my life, it is true!" she answered, with
a piteous quiver in her voice; adding: "I was hurrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
through the room, and there I must have dropped it. I
searched for it in every other place."</p>

<p>"Then hear what I say," he retorted, with an oath,
"in these very grounds I shall stay until you come to
me. I know well that old Joe is astir at dawn. You
must be up then, find the money which you say you
dropped, and bring it out to me. I will be waiting for
you at the same place."</p>

<p>Before she could utter a word of protest, he had turned
and disappeared in the darkness.</p>

<p>All night long Ida Mallard paced the floor of her
room, scarcely heeding the hours that dragged their slow
lengths by. Dawn came before she realized it. She was
startled from her reverie by hearing old Joe throwing
open the shutters about the house. That recalled her
to a realization of passing events.</p>

<p>Joe had unlocked the door of the dining-room at last,
but his sight was so poor that he could not espy a small
roll of bills lying on the floor.</p>

<p>Ida, gliding into the room as soon as his footsteps
echoed down the corridor, found the package.</p>

<p>She stole to the door as soon as it was unlocked.</p>

<p>Ah! how sweet and fragrant was the early morning.
How cool and green the grass looked, wet with the
morning dew! Little she dreamed that ere the day
waned that same grass would be dyed with a human
being's blood.</p>

<p>She shivered as she stepped forth into the grounds.
With hurried steps she crossed the lawn, and went into
the rose-garden beyond. There she saw Royal Ainsley.
He was pacing the little path by the brook, his face
white, his eyes angry-looking, downcast and sullen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>"So you have come at last, eh?" he exclaimed, angrily.</p>

<p>"I am here," she responded, tremulously.</p>

<p>"I was just about to go and wake up the household,"
he cried, his rage increasing.</p>

<p>"Now, that I am here, you will not have to do that,"
she answered, wearily.</p>

<p>"Where is the money?" he asked, abruptly.</p>

<p>She held it in her hand, but clutched it more tightly.</p>

<p>"I have it with me," she responded; "but it is not
yours until you carry out your promises!"</p>

<p>He looked at her with a cunning gleam in his eyes.</p>

<p>"To be sure I will carry out my agreement," he said.</p>

<p>"But I must have proof that you will do so before I
part with so much money," she said. "You must give
me your written word that you will never trouble me
again. You must also tell me where I can find my child,
for I see that you have not kept your word about bringing
her with you!"</p>

<p>He laughed aloud&mdash;a harsh, mocking laugh.</p>

<p>"I am not surprised at hearing a remark like that
from your lips. A woman who could abandon her child
as easily as <i>you</i> did, without so much as knowing its
fate, and who is content to live here as Eugene Mallard's
wife, whenever he is ready to take you to his heart, is
capable of doing anything. I do not wonder that you
supposed the little one was here in the grounds all night
long awaiting your fancy to appear!"</p>

<p>She recoiled at the words as though he had struck her
a blow.</p>

<p>"Let me tell you where your child is," he said, hoarsely.
"You shall know its fate!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, he seized the hand that held the money,
and tore the bills from her grasp.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_LX" id="CHAPTER_LX">CHAPTER LX.</a></h2>


<p>Ida sunk on her knees before him.</p>

<p>"Come," he said; "you must go quietly with me."</p>

<p>"Inhuman monster!" moaned Ida.</p>

<p>"Come. This is no time to exchange compliments," he
said. "We have parleyed here too long already."</p>

<p>His grasp tightened on the slender wrist, but she did
not seem to heed the pain of it.</p>

<p>"I can not, I will not go with you!" she panted.</p>

<p>A taunting laugh answered her. He was dragging her
by main force down the path, when the figure of a man
suddenly sprung before him.</p>

<p>"You!" cried Royal Ainsley, furiously.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is I!" returned Eugene Mallard, sternly. "I
am just in time, it appears, to save my&mdash;this lady from
you."</p>

<p>At the sight of Eugene, Ida flung up her hands with a
wild cry, and sunk at his feet unconscious. Royal Ainsley
sprung forward to catch her in his arms, but Eugene
dashed up to him.</p>

<p>"Lay one hand on her at your peril!" he commanded.</p>

<p>"And who shall prevent me, when she is my wife?"
sneered Royal Ainsley.</p>

<p>"She is <i>not</i> your wife!" cried Eugene Mallard, his
face darkening; "and here and now, I propose to avenge
the wrongs you have done her. There will be a duel to
the death between us! I have two pistols in my pocket,
you shall take one and defend yourself, I will use the
other."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>Royal Ainsley sprung forward. Quick as a flash he
drew something from his vest-pocket. It was a sharp
steel dagger which he always carried.</p>

<p>He made a lunge forward, but his foot slipped, and
he fell to the earth in mortal pain. The dagger he had
intended to plunge into the body of his cousin had been
the cause of his own death.</p>

<p>In an instant Eugene was bending over him.</p>

<p>"It is too late!" gasped the miserable man&mdash;"it is
all over with me now. I am about to pass in my checks.
Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Eugene; "you are mortally wounded, I
can see that. Heaven forgive you for the sins you
have committed!"</p>

<p>Eugene carried Ida to her own room, thanking Heaven
that he had met no one. No one would know of her
presence in the grounds.</p>

<p>Then he quickly summoned the servants.</p>

<p>Royal Ainsley, lying there with his face upturned to
the sunlight and his hand clutching the fatal dagger, told
its own story.</p>

<p>As soon as Ida was able to see him Eugene sent for her
to come to the library.</p>

<p>When she received the summons, the poor soul, white
as death, fell upon her knees.</p>

<p>"He is going to denounce me for my sin, and for not
telling him when I found it out," she said.</p>

<p>Could she face him, now that he knew all?</p>

<p>As she knelt there she caught a glimpse of herself in
the great mirror opposite.</p>

<p>Again the girl knocked at the door.</p>

<p>"Tell your master that I will see him to-morrow," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
whispered in a strained, strange voice; and the girl went
away.</p>

<p>Strange fancies seemed to throng through her brain.</p>

<p>Royal Ainsley was dead, she had heard them say; and
she fancied that her child was dead, too.</p>

<p>And now the man she loved had sent for her to turn
her from the house, and she would never see him again.</p>

<p>Then she thought of the brook, so deep, so wide, that
struggled on to meet the sea.</p>

<p>Yes, she would go there where some of the happiest,
ay, and some of the most sorrowful moments of her life
had been spent. The deep waters would carry her away
on their bosom.</p>

<p>At intervals the girl came to the door to inquire if she
wanted anything. The answer was always the same&mdash;"No."</p>

<p>She never knew how the long hours passed; she was
like one in a dream.</p>

<p>At last night came. She waited until the house was
dark and still. There was silence in the hall. All the
lights were out, every one was asleep, and the troubles
of the day were blotted out.</p>

<p>She raised the long French window that opened out
onto the lawn and stepped out into the garden.</p>

<p>As she passed the room in which Eugene Mallard was
quietly sleeping, she knelt and laid her cold white lips
on the threshold his feet would press.</p>

<p>How cruelly Heaven had punished her, because in
those other days she had longed to be a lady, like the
heroines she had read of in the great world of beauty
and fashion.</p>

<p>She reached the brook and knelt down beside it. The
moon threw a silvery light upon it, and in its song she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
seemed to hear Eugene's voice mingled with that of the
little child she had lost.</p>

<p>"I am coming to you, little baby!" she muttered below
her breath. Then aloud, she said: "Good-bye, Eugene&mdash;good-bye
forever!"</p>

<p>Suddenly a pair of strong arms clasped her, and Eugene's
voice whispered:</p>

<p>"Not good-bye, my darling!"</p>

<p>Only the stars and the moonlight and the rippling
waters of the brook heard what he said&mdash;how he pleaded
with her to live only for him and her little child.</p>

<p>Ida could not believe the great happiness that had suddenly
fallen upon her like a mantle from God's hands.</p>

<p>They talked by the brook-side for long hours. The
next day the master and mistress of the great mansion
went away.</p>

<p>When they reached New York, another ceremony was
performed, which made Ida Eugene Mallard's wife until
death should part them.</p>

<p>Then they quietly went and obtained the little child,
whom both idolized, and went abroad, where they remained
for years.</p>

<p>No one learned the strange romance of the fair young
girl whom Eugene Mallard worshipped so fondly.</p>

<p>When they returned to their home, years after, with
a lovely, dark-eyed little girl and a sturdy, blue-eyed boy,
no one guessed but that they were Eugene Mallard's
children.</p>

<p>While they had been abroad they read of the marriage
of Hildegarde Cramer to Philip Ravenswood, the
noble young man who had loved her ever since they had
first met on the Newport sands.</p>

<p>The same paper also brought the intelligence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
engagement of Arthur Hollis and pretty Dora Staples,
and the sad ending, in a railroad accident, of beautiful,
hapless Vivian Deane and her maid Nora.</p>

<p>Eugene passed the paper to his wife, and Ida read it,
making no comments. But after awhile, as though the
subject weighed heavily on her mind, she went up to Eugene,
and laid her soft white arms round his neck, and
whispered:</p>

<p>"Does the knowledge of Hildegarde's marriage bring
you any regrets, Eugene?"</p>

<p>"No, my darling!" he cried, clasping her in his strong
arms. "For all the love of my heart is yours now, and&mdash;and&mdash;our
children's."</p>

<p>"I have often wanted to ask you, Eugene," she murmured,
with her face hidden on his breast, "if the story
of my past were known, how would people judge me?
Would the world say, 'Ida May had sinned'?"</p>

<p>Let us hope all our readers will join heartily in his
answer&mdash;"No."</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second

Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
